2.0    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis package contains a golang implementation of Swagger 2.0 (aka OpenAPI 2.0):\nit knows how to serialize and deserialize swagger specifications.\nSwagger is a simple yet powerful representation of your RESTful API.\n\n Swagger in a nutshell\nWith the largest ecosystem of API tooling on the planet, thousands of developers are supporting Swagger in almost every modern programming language and deployment environment.\nWith a Swagger-enabled API, you get interactive documentation, client SDK generation and discoverability. We created Swagger to help fulfill the promise of APIs.\nSwagger helps companies like Apigee, Getty Images, Intuit, LivingSocial, McKesson, Microsoft, Morningstar, and PayPal build the best possible services with RESTful APIs. Now in version 2.0, Swagger is more enabling than ever. And it's 100% open source software.\n\nFeatures\ngo-swagger brings to the go community a complete suite of fully-featured, high-performance, API components to  work with a Swagger API: server, client and data model.\n\nGenerates a server from a swagger specification\nGenerates a client from a swagger specification\nGenerates a CLI (command line tool) from a swagger specification (alpha stage)\nSupports most features offered by jsonschema and swagger, including polymorphism\nGenerates a swagger specification from annotated go code\nAdditional tools to work with a swagger spec\nGreat customization features, with vendor extensions and customizable templates\n\nOur focus with code generation is to produce idiomatic, fast go code, which plays nice with golint, go vet etc.\nProject status\ngo-swagger is now feature complete and has stabilized its API.\nMost features and building blocks are now in a stable state, with a rich set of CI tests.\nThe go-openapi community actively continues bringing fixes and enhancements to this code base.\nThere is still much room for improvement: contributors and PR's are welcome. You may also get in touch with maintainers on our slack channel.\nDocumentation\nhttps://goswagger.io\nFAQ\nQ&A contributed by the community:\nhttps://goswagger.io/faq/\nHow is this different from go generator in swagger-codegen?\ntl;dr The main difference at this moment is that this one actually works...\nThe swagger-codegen project only generates a workable go client and even there it will only support flat models.\nFurther, the go server generated by swagger-codegen is mostly a stub.\n\nMotivation\nWhy is this not done as a part of the swagger-codegen project? Because:\n\nI don't really know java very well and so I'd be learning both java and the object model of the codegen which was in heavy flux as opposed to doing go and I really wanted to go experience of designing a large codebase with it.\nGo's super limited type system makes it so that it doesn't fit well in the model of swagger-codegen\nGo's idea of polymorphism doesn't reconcile very well with a solution designed for languages that actually have inheritance and so forth.\nFor supporting types like [][][]map[string][][]int64 I don't think it's possible with mustache\n\nI gravely underestimated the amount of work that would be involved in making something useful out of it.\nMy personal mission: I want the jvm to go away, it was great way back when now it's just silly (vm in container on vm in vm in container)\n\nWhat's inside?\nHere is an outline of available features (see the full list here):\n\nAn object model that serializes swagger-compliant yaml or json\nA tool to work with swagger\nServe swagger UI for any swagger spec file\nFlexible code generation, with customizable templates\nGenerate go API server based on swagger spec\nGenerate go API client from a swagger spec\n\n\nValidate a swagger spec document, with extra rules outlined here\nGenerate a spec document based on annotated code\n\n\nA runtime to work with Rest API and middlewares\nServe spec\nRouting\nValidation\nAuthorization\nSwagger docs UI\nA Diff tool which will cause a build to fail if a change in the spec breaks backwards compatibility\n\n\n\nThere is more to that...\n\nA typed JSON Schema implementation, supporting most Draft 4 features\nExtended string and numeric formats: strfmt\nUtilities to work with JSON, convert data types and pointers: swag\nA jsonschema (Draft 4) validator, with full $ref support: validate\nCustom validation interface\n\nInstalling\ngo-swagger is available as binary or docker releases as well as from source: more details.\nUse-cases\nThe main package of the toolkit, go-swagger/go-swagger, provides command line tools to help working with swagger.\nThe toolkit is highly customizable and allows endless possibilities to work with OpenAPI2.0 specifications.\nBeside the go-swagger CLI tool and generator, the go-openapi packages provide modular functionality to build custom solutions on top of OpenAPI.\nThe CLI supports shell autocompletion utilities: see here.\nServe specification UI\nMost basic use-case: serve a UI for your spec:\nswagger serve https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/master/examples/v2.0/json/petstore-expanded.json\nValidate a specification\nTo validate a Swagger specification:\nswagger validate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/master/examples/v2.0/json/petstore-expanded.json\nGenerate an API server\nTo generate a server for a swagger spec document:\nswagger generate server [-f ./swagger.json] -A [application-name [--principal [principal-name]]\nGenerate an API client\nTo generate a client for a swagger spec document:\nswagger generate client [-f ./swagger.json] -A [application-name [--principal [principal-name]]\nGenerate an CLI (Command line tool)\nTo generate a CLI for a swagger spec document:\nswagger generate cli [-f ./swagger.json] -A [application-name [--principal [principal-name]]\nGenerate a spec from source\nTo generate a swagger spec document for a go application:\nswagger generate spec -o ./swagger.json\nGenerate a data model\nTo generate model structures and validators exposed by the API:\nswagger generate model --spec={spec}\nTransform specs\nThere are several commands allowing you to transform your spec.\nResolve and expand $ref's in your spec as inline definitions:\nswagger expand {spec}\nFlatten your spec: all external $ref's are imported into the main document and inline schemas reorganized as definitions.\nswagger flatten {spec}\nMerge specifications (composition):\nswagger mixin {spec1} {spec2}\nCompare specs\nThe  diff command allows you to check backwards compatibility.\nType swagger diff --help for info.\nswagger diff {spec1} {spec2}\nGenerate spec markdown spec\nswagger generate markdown -f {spec} --output swagger.mode\nTry it\nTry go-swagger in a free online workspace using Gitpod:\n\nLicensing\nThe toolkit itself is licensed as Apache Software License 2.0.

When no changes are required to the contract,\nall is great because people can keep doing what they were doing and everybody is happy.\nHowever it might be that some change is required for the front-end, let's say they need a boolean added to some model\nbecause they want to display an \"accepted-terms-and-conditions\" checkbox.\nThe back-end can decide to add this to the code, provide the necessary annotation and regenerate the swagger\nspecification document.\nThis is the code first approach for swagger.\nThe toolkit\nThis toolkit supports both ways.\nIt tries to do so while staying as close as possible to the go stdlib interfaces, it tries to have no opinions\nbesides the fact that documentation is important.\nIt tries to integrate well with the rest of the go ecosystem as well as the swagger ecosystem.\nA series of contrib projects will add higher level optional functionality so that you can use the generated code with\nconfidence whether your application is your personal blog or the next AWS.\n"},"install.html":{"url":"install.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"Installing\nIMPORTANT NOTE: go-swagger is a tool to mainly generate or analyze source code.

In this example we build a server and a client.\n\nTo create your application start with swagger init:\nswagger init spec \\\n  --title \"A Todo list application\" \\\n  --description \"From the todo list tutorial on goswagger.io\" \\\n  --version 1.0.0 \\\n  --scheme http \\\n  --consumes application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json \\\n  --produces application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nThis gives you a skeleton swagger.yml file:\n---\nconsumes:\n- application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\ndefinitions: {}\ninfo:\n  description: From the todo list tutorial on goswagger.io\n  title: A Todo list application\n  version: 1.0.0\npaths: {}\nproduces:\n- application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nschemes:\n- http\nswagger: \"2.0\"\n\nThis doesn't do much but it does pass validation:\n± ~/go/src/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/examples/tutorials/todo-list\ngit:(master) ✗ ? » swagger validate ./swagger.yml\nThe swagger spec at \"./swagger.yml\" is valid against swagger specification 2.0\nNow that you have an empty but valid specification document, it's time to declare some models and endpoints for the API. You'll need a model to represent a todo item, so you can define that in the definitions section:\n---\ndefinitions:\n  item:\n    type: object\n    required:\n      - description\n    properties:\n      id:\n        type: integer\n        format: int64\n        readOnly: true\n      description:\n        type: string\n        minLength: 1\n      completed:\n        type: boolean\n\nIn this model definition we say that the model item is an object with a required property description. This item model has 3 properties: id, description, and completed. The id property is an int64 value and is marked as readOnly, meaning that it will be provided by the API server and it will be ignored when the item is created.\nThis document also says that the description must be at least 1 char long, which results in a string property that's not a pointer.\nAt this moment you have enough so that actual code could be generated, but let's continue defining the rest of the API so that the code generation will be more useful. Now that you have a model so you can add some endpoints to list the todo's:\n---\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      tags:\n        - todos\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: list the todo operations\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n\nThis snippet of yaml defines a GET / operation and tags it with todos. Tagging things is useful for many tools, for example helping UI tools group endpoints appropriately. Code generators might turn them into 'controllers'. There is also a response defined with a generic description about the response content. Note that some generators will put the description into the http status message. The response also defines endpoint's return type. In this case the endpoint returns a list of todo items, so the schema is an array and the array will contain item objects, which you defined previously.\nBut wait a minute, what if there are 100's of todo items, will we just return all of them for everybody?  It would be good to add a since and limit param here. The ids will have to be ordered for a since param to work but you're in control of that so that's fine.\n---\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      tags:\n        - todos\n      parameters:\n        - name: since\n          in: query\n          type: integer\n          format: int64\n        - name: limit\n          in: query\n          type: integer\n          format: int32\n          default: 20\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: list the todo operations\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n\nWith this new version of the operation you now have query params. These parameters have defaults so users can leave them off and the API will still function as intended.\nHowever, this definition is extremely optimistic and only defines a response for the \"happy path\". It's very likely that the API will need to return errors too. That means you have to define a model errors, as well as at least one more response definition to cover the error response.\nThe error definition looks like this:\n---\ndefinitions:\n  error:\n    type: object\n    required:\n      - message\n    properties:\n      code:\n        type: integer\n        format: int64\n      message:\n        type: string\n\nFor the error response you can use the default response, on the assumption that every successful response from your API is defying the odds.\n---\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      tags:\n        - todos\n      parameters:\n        - name: since\n          in: query\n          type: integer\n          format: int64\n        - name: limit\n          in: query\n          type: integer\n          format: int32\n          default: 20\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: list the todo operations\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n        default:\n          description: generic error response\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/error\"\n\nAt this point you've defined your first endpoint completely. To improve the strength of this contract you could define responses for each of the status codes and perhaps return different error messages for different statuses. For now, the status code will be provided in the error message.\nTry validating the specification again with swagger validate ./swagger.yml to ensure that code generation will work as expected.

To make it useful you'll need to implement the actual logic behind those endpoints. And you'll also want to add some more endpoints, like adding a new todo item and updating an existing item to change its description or mark it completed.\nTo supporting  adding a todo item you should define a POST operation:\n---\npaths:\n  /:\n    post:\n      tags:\n        - todos\n      operationId: addOne\n      parameters:\n        - name: body\n          in: body\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n      responses:\n        201:\n          description: Created\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n        default:\n          description: error\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/error\"\n\nThis snippet has something new. You see that the parameters are defined using a schema that references our exist item model. Remember that we defined this object's id key as readOnly, so it will not be accepted as part of the POST body.\nNext you can define a DELETE to remove a todo item from the list:\n---\npaths:\n  /{id}:\n    delete:\n      tags:\n        - todos\n      operationId: destroyOne\n      parameters:\n        - type: integer\n          format: int64\n          name: id\n          in: path\n          required: true\n      responses:\n        204:\n          description: Deleted\n        default:\n          description: error\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/error\"\n\nThis time you're defining a parameter that is part of the path. This operation will look in the URI templated path for an id. Since there's nothing to return after a delete, the success response  is 204 No Content.\nFinally, you need to define a way to update an existing item:\n---\npaths:\n  /{id}:\n    parameters:\n      - type: integer\n        format: int64\n        name: id\n        in: path\n        required: true\n    put:\n      tags: [\"todos\"]\n      operationId: updateOne\n      parameters:\n        - name: body\n          in: body\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: OK\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n        default:\n          description: error\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/error\"\n    delete:\n      # elided for brevity\n\nThere are two approaches typically taken for updates. A PUT indicates that the entire entity is being replaced, and a PATCH indicates that only the fields provided in the request should be updated. In the above example, you can see that the PUT \"brute force\" approach is being used.\nAnother thing to note is that because the /{id} path is shared for both DELETE and PUT, they can share a parameters definition.\nAt this point you should have a complete specification for the todo list API:\n---\nswagger: \"2.0\"\ninfo:\n  description: From the todo list tutorial on goswagger.io\n  title: A Todo list application\n  version: 1.0.0\nconsumes:\n- application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nproduces:\n- application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nschemes:\n- http\n- https\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      tags:\n        - todos\n      operationId: findTodos\n      parameters:\n        - name: since\n          in: query\n          type: integer\n          format: int64\n        - name: limit\n          in: query\n          type: integer\n          format: int32\n          default: 20\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: list the todo operations\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n        default:\n          description: generic error response\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/error\"\n    post:\n      tags:\n        - todos\n      operationId: addOne\n      parameters:\n        - name: body\n          in: body\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n      responses:\n        201:\n          description: Created\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n        default:\n          description: error\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/error\"\n  /{id}:\n    parameters:\n      - type: integer\n        format: int64\n        name: id\n        in: path\n        required: true\n    put:\n      tags:\n        - todos\n      operationId: updateOne\n      parameters:\n        - name: body\n          in: body\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: OK\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n        default:\n          description: error\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/error\"\n    delete:\n      tags:\n        - todos\n      operationId: destroyOne\n      responses:\n        204:\n          description: Deleted\n        default:\n          description: error\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/error\"\ndefinitions:\n  item:\n    type: object\n    required:\n      - description\n    properties:\n      id:\n        type: integer\n        format: int64\n        readOnly: true\n      description:\n        type: string\n        minLength: 1\n      completed:\n        type: boolean\n  error:\n    type: object\n    required:\n      - message\n    properties:\n      code:\n        type: integer\n        format: int64\n      message:\n        type: string\n\nThis is a good time to sanity check and by validating the schema:\n± ~/go/src/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/examples/tutorials/todo-list/server-2\ngit:(master) ✗ !? » swagger validate ./swagger.yml\nThe swagger spec at \"./swagger.yml\" is valid against swagger specification 2.0\nNow you're ready to generate the API and start filling in the actual operations:\ngit:(master) ✗ !? » swagger generate server -A TodoList -f ./swagger.yml\n... elided output ...\n2015/12/31 18:16:28 rendered main template: server.TodoList\n± ~/go/src/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/examples/tutorials/todo-list/server-2\ngit:(master) ✗ !? » tree\n.\n├── cmd\n│   └── todo-list-server\n│       └── main.go\n├── models\n│   ├── error.go\n│   ├── find_todos_okbody.go\n│   └── item.go\n├── restapi\n│   ├── configure_todo_list.go\n│   ├── doc.go\n│   ├── embedded_spec.go\n│   ├── operations\n│   │   ├── todo_list_api.go\n│   │   └── todos\n│   │       ├── add_one.go\n│   │       ├── add_one_parameters.go\n│   │       ├── add_one_responses.go\n│   │       ├── add_one_urlbuilder.go\n│   │       ├── destroy_one.go\n│   │       ├── destroy_one_parameters.go\n│   │       ├── destroy_one_responses.go\n│   │       ├── destroy_one_urlbuilder.go\n│   │       ├── find_todos.go\n│   │       ├── find_todos_parameters.go\n│   │       ├── find_todos_responses.go\n│   │       ├── find_todos_urlbuilder.go\n│   │       ├── update_one.go\n│   │       ├── update_one_parameters.go\n│   │       ├── update_one_responses.go\n│   │       └── update_one_urlbuilder.go\n│   └── server.go\n└── swagger.yml\n\n6 directories, 26 files\nTo implement the core of your application you start by editing restapi/configure_todo_list.go. This file is safe to edit. Its content will not be overwritten if you run swagger generate again the future.\nThe simplest way to implement this application is to simply store all the todo items in a golang map. This provides a simple way to move forward without bringing in complications like a database or files.\nTo do this you'll need a map and a counter to track the last assigned id:\n// the variables we need throughout our implementation\nvar items = make(map[int64]*models.Item)\nvar lastID int64\n\nThe simplest handler to implement now is the delete handler. Because the store is a map and the id of the item is provided in the request it's a one liner.\napi.TodosDestroyOneHandler = todos.DestroyOneHandlerFunc(func(params todos.DestroyOneParams) middleware.Responder {\n  delete(items, params.ID)\n  return todos.NewDestroyOneNoContent()\n})\n\nAfter deleting the item from the store, you need to provide a response. The code generator created responders for each response you defined in the the swagger specification, and you can see how one of those is being used in the example above.\nThe other 3 handler implementations are similar to this one. They are provided in the source for this tutorial.\nSo assuming you go ahead and implement the remainder of the endpoints, you're all set to test it out:\n» curl -i localhost:8765\nHTTP/1.1 200

Tutorial\nIn this tutorial we'll be building up a custom server.\nThe core will be generated using a manually written and maintained OpenAPI 2.0 spec.\nThe cli code will be a thin layer around that, and will simply setup the API and server,\nusing the parsed configurations and our hand written handlers.\n\nThe server we'll building will be very simple.\nIn this tutorial we'll assume you are already familiar with defining an API,\nusing the OpenAPI 2.0 yaml specification format.\nPlease consult the official OpenAPI 2.0 specification\nfor more information in case you're new to OpenAPI (Also known as Swagger).\nThe end product of this tutorial can be found as ./examples/tutorials/custom-server.\nThe server we'll be building, will be generated using the following spec:\n---\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 1.0.0\n  title: Greeting Server\npaths:\n  /hello:\n    get:\n      produces:\n        - text/plain\n      parameters:\n        - name: name\n          required: false\n          type: string\n          in: query\n          description: defaults to World if not given\n      operationId: getGreeting\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: returns a greeting\n          schema:\n              type: string\n              description: contains the actual greeting as plain text\n\nAs you can see, there is only 1 operation,\nallowing us to focus on how to create a custom server,\nwithout losing track in the details of any specific implementation.\nWhere you store the specification is not important.\nBy default the swagger cli expects it to be stored as ./swagger.yml,\nbut we'll store it as ./swagger/swagger.yml, to keep our project's root folder clean and tidy.\nOnce we have our OpenAPI specification ready, it is time to generate our server.\nThis can be done using the following command, from within our root folder:\n$ swagger generate server -t gen -f ./swagger/swagger.yml --exclude-main -A greeter\nIn the command above we're specifying the -t (target) flag,\nspecifying that swagger should store all generated code in the given target directory. We're also specifying the -f flag, to explicitly define that our spec file can be found at ./swagger/swagger.yml, rather then the default ./swagger.yml. As we are writing a custom server, we also don't want the automatically generated cmd server, and is excluded using the --exclude-main flag. Finally we're also explicitly naming our server using the -A flag.\nPlease consult swagger generate server --help for more flags and information.\nOnce we've executed this command, you should have following file tree:\n├── gen\n│   └── restapi\n│       ├── configure_greeter.go\n│       ├── doc.go\n│       ├── embedded_spec.go\n│       ├── operations\n│       │   ├── get_greeting.go\n│       │   ├── get_greeting_parameters.go\n│       │   ├── get_greeting_responses.go\n│       │   ├── get_greeting_urlbuilder.go\n│       │   └── greeter_api.go\n│       └── server.go\n└── swagger\n    └── swagger.yml\nAfter generation we should find only 1 sub directory in our gen folder.\nrestapi, which contains the core server. It consists among other things out of the API (operations/greeter_api.go), operations (operations/*) and parameters (*_parameters.go).\nNote that in case we also had defined models in the global definitions section,\nthere would be a models folder as well in our gen folder,\ncontaining the generated models for those definitions.\nBut as we don't have any definitions to share, you won't find it in this tutorial.\nFor more information, read through the generated code.\nIt might help to keep the swagger/swagger.yml definition next to you,\nto help you realize what is defined, for what and where.\nSo now that we have the generated server, it is time to write our actual main file.\nIn it we'll parse some simple flags that can be used to configure the server,\nwe'll setup the API and finally start the server. All in all, very minimal and simple.\nso let's start writing the ./cmd/greeter/main.go file:\nWe start by defining our flags, in our example using the standard flag pkg:\nvar portFlag = flag.Int(\"port\", 3000, \"Port to run this service on\")\n\nNow it's time to write our main logic,\nstarting by loading our embedded swagger spec.\nThis is required, as it is used to configure the dynamic server,\nthe core of our generated server (found under the ./gen/restapi dir).\nswaggerSpec, err := loads.Analyzed(restapi.SwaggerJSON, \"\")\nif err != nil {\n    log.Fatalln(err)\n}\n\nWith the spec loaded in, we can create our API and server:\napi := operations.NewGreeterAPI(swaggerSpec)\nserver := restapi.NewServer(api)\ndefer server.Shutdown()\n\nWith the server created, we can overwrite the default port, using our portFlag:\nflag.Parse()\nserver.Port = *portFlag\n\nAfter that, we can serve our API and finish our main logic:\nif err := server.Serve(); err != nil {\n    log.Fatalln(err)\n}\n\nPutting that all together, we have the following main function:\nfunc main() {\n    // load embedded swagger file\n    swaggerSpec, err := loads.Analyzed(restapi.SwaggerJSON, \"\")\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalln(err)\n    }\n\n    // create new service API\n    api := operations.NewGreeterAPI(swaggerSpec)\n    server := restapi.NewServer(api)\n    defer server.Shutdown()\n\n    // parse flags\n    flag.Parse()\n    // set the port this service will be run on\n    server.Port = *portFlag\n\n    // TODO: Set Handle\n\n    // serve API\n    if err := server.Serve(); err != nil {\n        log.Fatalln(err)\n    }\n}\n\nNow that we have our server defined, let's give it a first spin!\nYou can run it from our root directory using the following command:\n$ go run ./cmd/greeter/main.go --port 3000\nLet's now try to call our only defined operation,\nusing the httpie cli:\n$ http get :3000/hello\nSadly this gives us the following output:\nHTTP/1.1 501 Not Implemented\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 50\nContent-Type: text/plain\nDate: Thu, 26 Jan 2017 13:09:52 GMT\n\noperation GetGreeting has not yet been implemented\n\nThe good news is that our OpenAPI-based Golang service is working.\nThe bad news is that we haven't implemented our handlers yet.\nWe'll need one handler per operation, that does the actual logic.\nYou might wonder why it does give us a sane response, rather then panicking.\nAfter grepping for that error message, or using a recursive search in your favorite editor, you'll find that this error originates from the greeter API constructor (NewGreeterAPI) found in ./gen/restapi/operations/greeter_api.go.\nHere we'll see that all our consumers, producers and handlers have sane defaults.\nSo now that we know that we just got our ass saved by go-swagger,\nlet's actually start working towards implementing our handlers.\nInspecting the gen/restapi/operations/get_greeting.go file,\nwe'll find the following snippet:\n// GetGreetingHandlerFunc turns a function with the right signature into a get greeting handler\ntype GetGreetingHandlerFunc func(GetGreetingParams) middleware.Responder\n\n// Handle executing the request and returning a response\nfunc (fn GetGreetingHandlerFunc) Handle(params GetGreetingParams) middleware.Responder {\n    return fn(params)\n}\n\nHere we can read that there is a function type GetGreetingHandlerFunc, defined for the getGreeting operation which takes in one parameter of type GetGreetingParams and returns a middleware.Responder. This is the type alias our Handler has to adhere to.\nA bit more down we'll also encounter an interface GetGreetingHandler, defined for the getGreeting operation:\n// GetGreetingHandler interface for that can handle valid get greeting params\ntype GetGreetingHandler interface {\n    Handle(GetGreetingParams) middleware.Responder\n}\n\nIts only defined method looks very similar to the function type GetGreetingHandlerFunc function defined above. This is no coincidence.\nEven better, the GetGreetingHandlerFunc implements the Handle function as defined by the GetGreetingHandler interface, meaning that we can use a function respecting the type alias as defined by GetGreetingHandlerFunc, where we normally would have to implement a struct adhering to the GetGreetingHandler interface.\nImplementing our handler as a struct allows us to handle with a certain state in mind. You can check out the kvstore example to see a more elaborate example, where you can see the handlers being implemented using a struct per operation.\nOur Greeter API is however simple enough, that we'll opt for just a simple method.\nKISS never grows old. So with all of this said, let's implement our one and only handler.\nBack to the ./cmd/greeter/main.go file, we'll define our handler as follows:\napi.GetGreetingHandler = operations.GetGreetingHandlerFunc(\n    func(params operations.GetGreetingParams) middleware.Responder {\n        name := swag.StringValue(params.Name)\n        if name == \"\" {\n            name = \"World\"\n        }\n\n        greeting := fmt.Sprintf(\"Hello, %s!\", name)\n        return operations.NewGetGreetingOK().WithPayload(greeting)\n    })\n\nWhich replaces the TODO: Set Handle comment, originally defined.\nLet's break down the snippet above.\nFirst we make use of the go-openapi/swag package, which is full of Goodies.\nIn this case we use the StringValue function which transforms a *string into a string. The result will be empty in case it was nil. This comes in handy as we know that our parameter can be nil when not given, as it is not required. Finally we form our greeting and return it as our payload with our 200 OK response.\nLet's run our server:\n$ go run ./cmd/greeter/main.go --port 3000\nAnd now we're ready to test our greeter API once again:\n$ http get :3000/hello\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 13\nContent-Type: text/plain\nDate: Thu, 26 Jan 2017 13:47:49 GMT\n\nHello, World!\n\nHurray, let's now greet Swagger:\n$ http get :3000/hello name==Swagger\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 15\nContent-Type: text/plain\nDate: Thu, 26 Jan 2017 13:48:40 GMT\n\nHello, Swagger!\n\nGreat, Swagger will be happy to hear that.\nAs we just learned, using go-swagger and a manually defined OpenAPI2.0 specification file, we can build a Golang service with minimal effort. Please read the other go-swagger docs for more information about how to use it and its different elements.\nAlso please checkout the kvstore example for a more complex example.\nIt is the main inspiration for this tutorial and has been built using the exact\nsame techniques as described in this tutorial.\n"},"tutorial/dynamic.html":{"url":"tutorial/dynamic.html","title":"Dynamic Server","keywords":"","body":"Dynamic API definition\nThe toolkit supports building a swagger specification entirely with go code.

Because we have no implementation yet, we register a notImplemented handler for all of them.\nOur api descriptor validation is now satisfied, so we use the simplest way to start a http server in go on port 8000.\nServer terminal:\ngit:(master) ✗ -!? » go run main.go ./swagger.yml\n2016/10/08 23:35:18 loading \"./swagger.yml\" as contract for the server\n2016/10/08 23:35:18 serving A To Do list application at http://localhost:8000\nClient terminal:\ngit:(master) ✗ -!? » curl -i localhost:8000\nHTTP/1.1 501 Not Implemented\nContent-Type: application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nDate: Sun, 09 Oct 2016 06:36:11 GMT\nContent-Length: 18\n\n\"not implemented\"\n\n\nThere is a lot more to be done to make this server a production ready server, but for the\npurpose of this tutorial, this is enough.\n\nCompletely untyped\nAt this point we're ready to actually implement some functionality for our Todo list. We'll create methods to add, update and delete an item.\nWe'll also render a list of known items. Because http APIs can get concurrent access we need to take care of this as well.\nThe first thing we'll do is build our \"backend\", a very simple implementation based on a slice and maps.\nvar items = []map[string]interface{}{\n    map[string]interface{}{\"id\": int64(1), \"description\": \"feed dog\", \"completed\": true},\n    map[string]interface{}{\"id\": int64(2), \"description\": \"feed cat\"},\n}\n\nvar itemsLock = &sync.Mutex{}\nvar lastItemID int64 = 2\n\nfunc newItemID() int64 {\n    return atomic.AddInt64(&lastItemID, 1)\n}\n\nfunc addItem(item map[string]interface{}) {\n    itemsLock.Lock()\n    defer itemsLock.Unlock()\n    item[\"id\"] = newItemID()\n    items = append(items, item)\n}\n\nfunc updateItem(id int64, body map[string]interface{}) (map[string]interface{}, error) {\n    itemsLock.Lock()\n    defer itemsLock.Unlock()\n\n    item, err := itemByID(id)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    delete(body, \"id\")\n    for k, v := range body {\n        item[k] = v\n    }\n    return item, nil\n}\n\nfunc removeItem(id int64) {\n    itemsLock.Lock()\n    defer itemsLock.Unlock()\n\n    var newItems []map[string]interface{}\n    for _, item := range items {\n        if item[\"id\"].(int64) != id {\n            newItems = append(newItems, item)\n        }\n    }\n    items = newItems\n}\n\nfunc itemByID(id int64) (map[string]interface{}, error) {\n    for _, item := range items {\n        if item[\"id\"].(int64) == id {\n            return item, nil\n        }\n    }\n    return nil, errors.NotFound(\"not found: item %d\", id)\n}\n\nsee source of this code\nThe backend code builds a todo-list-item store that's save for concurrent access buy guarding every operation with a lock. This is all in memory so as soon as you quit the process all your changes will be reset.\nBecause we now have an actual implementation that we can use for testings, lets hook that up in our API:\nfunc main() {\n    if len(os.Args) == 1 {\n        log.Fatalln(\"this command requires the swagger spec as argument\")\n    }\n    log.Printf(\"loading %q as contract for the server\", os.Args[1])\n\n    specDoc, err := loads.Spec(os.Args[1])\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalln(err)\n    }\n\n    // our spec doesn't have application/json in the consumes or produces\n    // so we need to clear those settings out\n    api := untyped.NewAPI(specDoc).WithoutJSONDefaults()\n\n    // register serializers\n    mediaType := \"application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\"\n    api.DefaultConsumes = mediaType\n    api.DefaultProduces = mediaType\n    api.RegisterConsumer(mediaType, runtime.JSONConsumer())\n    api.RegisterProducer(mediaType, runtime.JSONProducer())\n\n    // register the operation handlers\n    api.RegisterOperation(\"GET\", \"/\", findTodos)\n    api.RegisterOperation(\"POST\", \"/\", addOne)\n    api.RegisterOperation(\"PUT\", \"/{id}\", updateOne)\n    api.RegisterOperation(\"DELETE\", \"/{id}\", destroyOne)\n\n    // validate the API descriptor, to ensure we don't have any unhandled operations\n    if err := api.Validate(); err != nil {\n        log.Fatalln(err)\n    }\n\n    // construct the application context for this server\n    // use the loaded spec document and the api descriptor with the default router\n    app := middleware.NewContext(specDoc, api, nil)\n\n    log.Println(\"serving\", specDoc.Spec().Info.Title, \"at http://localhost:8000\")\n\n    // serve the api with spec and UI\n    if err := http.ListenAndServe(\":8000\", app.APIHandler(nil)); err != nil {\n        log.Fatalln(err)\n    }\n}\n\nvar findTodos = runtime.OperationHandlerFunc(func(params interface{}) (interface{}, error) {\n    log.Println(\"received 'findTodos'\")\n    log.Printf(\"%#v\\n\", params)\n\n    return items, nil\n})\n\nvar addOne = runtime.OperationHandlerFunc(func(params interface{}) (interface{}, error) {\n    log.Println(\"received 'addOne'\")\n    log.Printf(\"%#v\\n\", params)\n\n    body := params.(map[string]interface{})[\"body\"].(map[string]interface{})\n    addItem(body)\n    return body, nil\n})\n\nvar updateOne = runtime.OperationHandlerFunc(func(params interface{}) (interface{}, error) {\n    log.Println(\"received 'updateOne'\")\n    log.Printf(\"%#v\\n\", params)\n\n    data := params.(map[string]interface{})\n    id := data[\"id\"].(int64)\n    body := data[\"body\"].(map[string]interface{})\n    return updateItem(id, body)\n})\n\nvar destroyOne = runtime.OperationHandlerFunc(func(params interface{}) (interface{}, error) {\n    log.Println(\"received 'destroyOne'\")\n    log.Printf(\"%#v\\n\", params)\n\n    removeItem(params.(map[string]interface{})[\"id\"].(int64))\n    return nil, nil\n})\n\nsee source of this code\nWith this set up we should be able to start a server, send it some requests and get some meaningful answers.\nList all\ngit:(master) ✗ !?

We just wanted to demonstrate here how\nsecurity requirements may be composed out of several schemes, and use API authorizers.\n\nNote that we used the \"OAuth2\" declaration here but don't actually follow an OAuth2 workflow:\nour intend here is to be able to extract scopes from the claims passed in a JWT token \n(the only way to manipulate scoped authorizers with Swagger 2.0 is to declare them with type oauth2).\n\nCaveats\n\nThere should be at most one Authorization header: mixing \"Authorization Basic\" and \"Authorization Bearer\" won't work well\nThere should be at most one scoped authentication scheme: if we define several such authorizers they would all use the same bearer token\nThe \"OAuth2\" type supports other methods than the \"Authorization: Bearer\" header: the token may be passed\nusing the access_token query param (or urlEncoded form value)\nUnfortunately, Swagger 2.0 only supports \"OAuth2\" as a scoped method\nThere is one single principal and several methods to define it. Getting to these different intermediary principals requires some \ninteraction with the http request's context (e.g. using middleware.SecurityPrincipalFrom(req)). This is not demonstrated here for now.\n\nPrerequisites\njwt-go ships with a nice JWT CLI utility. Although not required, you might want to install it and \nplay with your own tokens:\n\ngo install github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go/cmd/jwt\n\nSwagger specification\nWe defined the following security schemes (in swagger.yml specification document):\nsecurityDefinitions:\n  isRegistered:\n    # This scheme uses the header: \"Authorization: Basic {base64 encoded string defined by username:password}\"\n    # Scopes are not supported with this type of authorization.\n    type: basic\n  isReseller:\n    # This scheme uses the header: \"X-Custom-Key: {base64 encoded string}\"\n    # Scopes are not supported with this type of authorization.\n    type: apiKey\n    in: header\n    name: X-Custom-Key\n  isResellerQuery:\n    # This scheme uses the query parameter \"CustomKeyAsQuery\"\n    # Scopes are not supported with this type of authorization.\n    type: apiKey\n    in: query\n    name: CustomKeyAsQuery\n  hasRole:\n    # This scheme uses the header: \"Authorization: Bearer {base64 encoded string representing a JWT}\"\n    # Alternatively, the query param: \"access_token\" may be used.\n    #\n    # In our scenario, we must use the query param version in order to avoid \n    # passing several headers with key 'Authorization'\n    type: oauth2\n    # The flow and URLs in spec are for documentary purpose: go-swagger does not implement OAuth workflows\n    flow: accessCode\n    authorizationUrl: 'https://dummy.oauth.net/auth'\n    tokenUrl: 'https://dumy.oauth.net/token'\n    # Required scopes are passed by the runtime to the authorizer\n    scopes:\n      customer: scope of registered customers\n      inventoryManager: scope of resellers acting as inventory managers\n\nWe specify the following security requirements:\n\nA default requirements for all endpoints: so by default, all endpoints use the Basic auth.\n\nsecurity:\n  - isRegistered: []\n\n\nSome endpoints are not restricted at all: this is made explicit by overriding the default security requirement with an empty array.\n\npaths:\n  /items:\n    get:\n      summary: items on sale\n      operationId: GetItems\n      description: |\n        Everybody should be able to access this operation\n      security: []\n...\n\n\nWe created endpoints with various compositions of our 3 security schemes\n\nExample: isRegistered AND hasRole[ customer ]\n  /order/{orderID}:\n    get:\n      summary: retrieves an order\n      operationId: GetOrder\n      description: |\n        Only registered customers should be able to retrieve orders\n      security: \n        - isRegistered: []\n          hasRole: [ customer ]  \n...\n\nExample: (isRegistered AND hasRole[ customer ]) OR (isReseller AND hasRole[ inventoryManager ]) OR (isResellerQuery AND hasRole[ inventoryManager ])\n  /order/add:\n    post:\n      summary: post a new order\n      operationId: AddOrder\n      description: |\n        Registered customers should be able to add purchase orders.\n        Registered inventory managers should be able to add replenishment orders.\n\n      security:\n        - isRegistered: []\n          hasRole: [ customer ]  \n        - isReseller: []\n          hasRole: [ inventoryManager ]  \n        - isResellerQuery: []\n          hasRole: [ inventoryManager ]  \n...\n\nExample: isReseller OR isResellerQuery\nThis one allows to pass an API key either by header or by query param.\n  /orders/{itemID}:\n    get:\n      summary: retrieves all orders for an item\n      operationId: GetOrdersForItem\n      description: |\n        Only registered resellers should be able to search orders for an item\n      security:\n        - isReseller: []\n        - isResellerQuery: []\n...\n\nWe need to specify a security principal in the model and generate the server with this. Operations will be passed this principal as \nparameter upon successful authentication.\nWhen using the scoped authentication (\"oauth2\"), our custom authorizer with pass all claimed roles that match the security requirement in the principal.\ndefinitions:\n  ...\n  principal:\n    type: object \n    properties: \n      name: \n        type: string\n      roles:\n        type: array \n        items: \n          type: string\n\nGenerate the server\nswagger generate server -A multi-auth-example -P models.Principal -f ./swagger.yml\n\nFiles restapi/configure_multi_auth_example.go and auth/authorizers.go are not generated.\nTesting configuration\nTest tokens and keys\nIn ./tokens, we provided with some ready made tokens. If you have installed the jwt CLI, \nyou can play around an build some different claims as JWT (see the make-tokens.sh script for usage).\n\nNOTE: tokens need a pair of public / private keys (for the signer and the verifier). We generated these keys \nfor testing purpose in the keys directory (RSA256 keys).\n\nOur JWT defines \"roles\" as custom claim (in auth/authorizers.go): this means the signer of the token acknowledges the \nholder of the token to be enabled for these.\n// roleClaims describes the format of our JWT token's claims\ntype roleClaims struct {\n    Roles []string `json:\"roles\"`\n    jwt.StandardClaims\n}\n\nConfigure the API with custom authorizers\nIn configure_multi_auth_example.go we have set up our custom authorizers:\nfunc configureAPI(api *operations.MultiAuthExampleAPI) http.Handler {\n    // configure the api here\n    api.ServeError = errors.ServeError\n\n    ...\n    logger := logging.MustGetLogger(\"api\")\n\n    api.Logger = logger.Infof\n\n    api.JSONConsumer = runtime.JSONConsumer()\n\n    api.JSONProducer = runtime.JSONProducer()\n\n    // Applies when the \"Authorization: Basic\" header is set with the Basic scheme\n    api.IsRegisteredAuth = func(user string, pass string) (*models.Principal, error) {\n        // The header: Authorization: Basic {base64 string} has already been decoded by the runtime as a username:password pair\n        api.Logger(\"IsRegisteredAuth handler called\")\n        return auth.IsRegistered(user, pass)\n    }\n\n    // Applies when the \"Authorization: Bearer\" header or the \"access_token\" query is set\n    api.HasRoleAuth = func(token string, scopes []string) (*models.Principal, error) {\n        // The header: Authorization: Bearer {base64 string} (or ?access_token={base 64 string} param) has already\n        // been decoded by the runtime as a token\n        api.Logger(\"HasRoleAuth handler called\")\n        return auth.HasRole(token, scopes)\n    }\n\n    // Applies when the \"CustomKeyAsQuery\" query is set\n    api.IsResellerQueryAuth = func(token string) (*models.Principal, error) {\n        api.Logger(\"ResellerQueryAuth handler called\")\n        return auth.IsReseller(token)\n    }\n\n    // Applies when the \"X-Custom-Key\" header is set\n    api.IsResellerAuth = func(token string) (*models.Principal, error) {\n        api.Logger(\"IsResellerAuth handler called\")\n        return auth.IsReseller(token)\n    }\n    ...\n\nThese authorizers are implemented in auth/authorizers.go.\nHere is the basic one:\n// IsRegistered determines if the user is properly registered,\n// i.e if a valid username:password pair has been provided\nfunc IsRegistered(user, pass string) (*models.Principal, error) {\n    logger.Debugf(\"Credentials: %q:%q\", user, pass)\n    if password, ok := userDb[user]; ok {\n        if pass == password {\n            return &models.Principal{\n                Name: user,\n            }, nil\n        }\n    }\n    logger.Debug(\"Bad credentials\")\n    return nil, errors.New(401, \"Unauthorized: not a registered user\")\n}\n\nWe did not set up actual operations: they are mere debug loggers, returning a \"Not implemented\" error.\nWe log on the serve console how the principal is passed to the operation.\n    api.AddOrderHandler = operations.AddOrderHandlerFunc(func(params operations.AddOrderParams, principal *models.Principal) middleware.Responder {\n        logger.Warningf(\"AddOrder called with params: %s, and principal: %s\", spew.Sdump(params.Order), spew.Sdump(principal))\n        return middleware.NotImplemented(\"operation .AddOrder has not yet been implemented\")\n    })\n\nRun the server\ngo run ./cmd/multi-auth-example-server/main.go --port 43016\n\nExercise your authorizers\nThere is a little exercising utility script: exerciser.sh. \nThis script pushes a sequence of curl requests. You may customize it to your liking and further exercise the API.\nAuthorizations actions and operations are logged on the server console.\nExample:\ncurl \\\n  --verbose \\\n  --get \\\n  --header

generation\nBuild a client\nThere is an example client provided at: https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/tree/master/examples/todo-list/client\nTo generate a client:\nswagger generate client -f [http-url|filepath] -A [application-name] [--principal [principal-name]]\nIf you want to debug what the client is sending and receiving you can set the environment value DEBUG to a non-empty\nvalue.\nUse a default client, which has an HTTP transport:\nimport (\n  \"log\"\n\n  \"github.com/myproject/client/operations\"\n  \"github.com/go-openapi/strfmt\"\n  \"github.com/go-openapi/spec\"\n\n  apiclient \"github.com/myproject/client\"\n  httptransport \"github.com/go-openapi/runtime/client\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\n  // make the request to get all items\n  resp, err := apiclient.Default.Operations.All(operations.AllParams{})\n  if err != nil {\n    log.Fatal(err)\n  }\n  fmt.Printf(\"%#v\\n\", resp.Payload)\n}\n\nThe client runtime allows for a number of configuration\noptions to be set.\nTo then use the client, and override the host, with a HTTP transport:\nimport (\n  \"os\"\n  \"log\"\n\n  \"github.com/myproject/client/operations\"\n  \"github.com/go-openapi/strfmt\"\n  \"github.com/go-openapi/spec\"\n\n  apiclient \"github.com/myproject/client\"\n  httptransport \"github.com/go-openapi/runtime/client\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\n  // create the transport\n  transport := httptransport.New(os.Getenv(\"TODOLIST_HOST\"), \"\", nil)\n\n  // create the API client, with the transport\n  client := apiclient.New(transport, strfmt.Default)\n\n  // to override the host for the default client\n  // apiclient.Default.SetTransport(transport)\n\n  // make the request to get all items\n  resp, err := client.Operations.All(operations.AllParams{})\n  if err != nil {\n    log.Fatal(err)\n  }\n  fmt.Printf(\"%#v\\n\", resp.Payload)\n}\n\nAuthentication\nThe client supports 3 authentication schemes:\n\nBasic Auth\nAPI key auth in header or query\nBearer token header for oauth2\n\nimport (\n  \"os\"\n  \"log\"\n\n  \"github.com/myproject/client/operations\"\n  \"github.com/go-openapi/strfmt\"\n  \"github.com/go-openapi/spec\"\n\n  apiclient \"github.com/myproject/client\"\n  httptransport \"github.com/go-openapi/runtime/client\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\n  // create the API client\n  client := apiclient.New(httptransport.New(\"\", \"\", nil), strfmt.Default)\n\n  // make the authenticated request to get all items\n  bearerTokenAuth := httptransport.BearerToken(os.Getenv(\"API_ACCESS_TOKEN\"))\n  // basicAuth := httptransport.BasicAuth(os.Getenv(\"API_USER\"), os.Getenv(\"API_PASSWORD\"))\n  // apiKeyQueryAuth := httptransport.APIKeyAuth(\"apiKey\", \"query\", os.Getenv(\"API_KEY\"))\n  // apiKeyHeaderAuth := httptransport.APIKeyAuth(\"X-API-TOKEN\", \"header\", os.Getenv(\"API_KEY\"))\n  resp, err := client.Operations.All(operations.AllParams{}, bearerTokenAuth)\n  // resp, err := client.Operations.All(operations.AllParams{}, basicAuth)\n  // resp, err := client.Operations.All(operations.AllParams{}, apiKeyQueryAuth)\n  // resp, err := client.Operations.All(operations.AllParams{}, apiKeyHeaderAuth)\n  if err != nil {\n    log.Fatal(err)\n  }\n  fmt.Printf(\"%#v\\n\", resp.Payload)\n}\n\nConsuming an XML API\nIn order to enable XML support, you need to set the command options --default-consumes or --default-produces to an XML mime type like application/xml when generating the client:\nswagger generate client -f [http-url|filepath] -A [application-name] --default-consumes application/xml\nThis is necessary regardless of whether your swagger specification already specifies XML in the consumes and produces properties.\nAn example using the generated client with default Bearer authentication:\nimport (\n  \"os\"\n\n  \"github.com/go-openapi/strfmt\"\n  \"github.com/go-openapi/runtime\"\n\n  apiclient \"github.com/myproject/client\"\n  httptransport \"github.com/go-openapi/runtime/client\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n  r := httptransport.New(apiclient.DefaultHost, apiclient.DefaultBasePath, apiclient.DefaultSchemes)\n  r.DefaultAuthentication = httptransport.BearerToken(os.Getenv(\"API_ACCESS_TOKEN\"))\n  /*\n  r.DefaultMediaType = runtime.XMLMime\n  r.Consumers = map[string]runtime.Consumer{\n    runtime.XMLMime: runtime.XMLConsumer(),\n  }\n  r.Producers = map[string]runtime.Producer{\n    \"application/xhtml+xml\": runtime.XMLProducer(),\n  }\n  */\n  client := apiclient.New(r, strfmt.Default)\n\n  resp, err := client.Operations.MyGreatEndpoint()\n  if err != nil {\n    log.Fatal(err)\n  }\n  fmt.Printf(\"%#v\\n\", resp.Payload)\n}\n\nIt can under certain circumstances be necessary to manually set the DefaultMediaType and the Consumers and Producers similar to the commented-out code above, particularly if you're using special mime types like application/xhtml+xml.\n"},"generate/cli.html":{"url":"generate/cli.html","title":"CLI (Command Line

generation of tag-based operation packages, resulting in a flat generation\nBuild a server\nThe server application gets generated with all the handlers stubbed out with a not implemented handler. That means that you can start the API server immediately after generating it. It will respond to all valid requests with 501 Not Implemented. When a request is invalid it will most likely respond with an appropriate 4xx response.\nThe generated server allows for a number of command line parameters to customize it.\n      --cleanup-timeout duration     grace period for which to wait before killing idle connections (default 10s)\n      --graceful-timeout duration    grace period for which to wait before shutting down the server (default 15s)\n      --host string                  the IP to listen on (default \"localhost\")\n      --keep-alive duration          sets the TCP keep-alive timeouts on accepted connections. It prunes dead TCP connections ( e.g. closing laptop mid-download) (default 3m0s)\n      --listen-limit int             limit the number of outstanding requests\n      --max-header-size byte-size    controls the maximum number of bytes the server will read parsing the request header's keys and values, including the request line. It does not limit the size of the request body (default 1MB)\n      --port int                     the port to listen on for insecure connections, defaults to a random value\n      --read-timeout duration        maximum duration before timing out read of the request (default 30s)\n      --scheme strings               the listeners to enable, this can be repeated and defaults to the schemes in the swagger spec (default [http,https,unix])\n      --socket-path string           the unix socket to listen on (default \"/var/run/todo-list.sock\")\n      --tls-ca string                the certificate authority certificate file to be used with mutual tls auth\n      --tls-certificate string       the certificate file to use for secure connections\n      --tls-host string              the IP to listen on (default \"localhost\")\n      --tls-keep-alive duration      sets the TCP keep-alive timeouts on accepted connections. It prunes dead TCP connections ( e.g. closing laptop mid-download) (default 3m0s)\n      --tls-key string               the private key file to use for secure connections (without passphrase)\n      --tls-listen-limit int         limit the number of outstanding requests\n      --tls-port int                 the port to listen on for secure connections, defaults to a random value\n      --tls-read-timeout duration    maximum duration before timing out read of the request (default 30s)\n      --tls-write-timeout duration   maximum duration before timing out write of the response (default 30s)\n      --write-timeout duration       maximum duration before timing out write of the response (default 30s)\nThe server takes care of a number of things when a request arrives:\n\nrouting\nauthentication\ninput validation\ncontent negotiation\nparameter and body binding\n\nTo illustrate this with a pseudo handler, this is what happens in a request.\nimport (\n  \"net/http\"\n\n  \"github.com/go-openapi/errors\"\n  \"github.com/go-openapi/runtime/middleware\"\n  \"github.com/gorilla/context\"\n)\n\nfunc newCompleteMiddleware(ctx *middleware.Context) http.Handler {\n  return http.HandlerFunc(func(rw http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    defer context.Clear(r)\n\n    // use context to lookup routes\n    if matched, ok := ctx.RouteInfo(r); ok {\n\n      if len(matched.Authenticators) > 0 {\n        if _, err := ctx.Authorize(r, matched); err != nil {\n          ctx.Respond(rw, r, matched.Produces, matched, err)\n          return\n        }\n      }\n\n      bound, validation := ctx.BindAndValidate(r, matched)\n      if validation != nil {\n        ctx.Respond(rw, r, matched.Produces, matched, validation)\n        return\n      }\n\n      result, err := matched.Handler.Handle(bound)\n      if err != nil {\n        ctx.Respond(rw, r, matched.Produces, matched, err)\n        return\n      }\n\n      ctx.Respond(rw, r, matched.Produces, matched, result)\n      return\n    }\n\n    // Not found, check if it exists in the other methods first\n    if others := ctx.AllowedMethods(r); len(others) > 0 {\n      ctx.Respond(rw, r, ctx.spec.RequiredProduces(), nil, errors.MethodNotAllowed(r.Method, others))\n      return\n    }\n    ctx.Respond(rw, r, ctx.spec.RequiredProduces(), nil, errors.NotFound(\"path %s was not found\", r.URL.Path))\n  })\n}\n\nPrior to handling requests however you probably want to configure the API with some actual implementations.  To do that you have to edit the configure_xxx.go file.  That file will only be generated the first time you generate a server application from a swagger spec. So the generated server uses this file to let you fill in the blanks.\nFor the todolist application that file looks like:\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"github.com/go-openapi/errors\"\n    \"github.com/go-openapi/runtime\"\n    \"github.com/go-openapi/runtime/middleware\"\n\n    \"github.com/go-openapi/examples/todo-list/restapi/operations\"\n    \"github.com/go-openapi/examples/todo-list/restapi/operations/todos\"\n)\n\n// This file is safe to edit. Once it exists it will not be overwritten\n\nfunc configureAPI(api *operations.ToDoListAPI) http.Handler {\n    // configure the api here\n    api.JSONConsumer = runtime.JSONConsumer()\n\n    api.JSONProducer = runtime.JSONProducer()\n\n    api.KeyAuth = func(token string) (interface{}, error) {\n        return nil, errors.NotImplemented(\"api key auth (key) x-petstore-token from header has not yet been implemented\")\n    }\n\n    api.AddOneHandler = todos.AddOneHandlerFunc(func(params todos.AddOneParams, principal interface{}) middleware.Responder {\n        return middleware.NotImplemented(\"operation addOne has not yet been implemented\")\n    })\n    api.DestroyOneHandler = todos.DestroyOneHandlerFunc(func(params todos.DestroyOneParams, principal interface{}) middleware.Responder {\n        return middleware.NotImplemented(\"operation destroyOne has not yet been implemented\")\n    })\n    api.FindHandler = todos.FindHandlerFunc(func(params todos.FindParams, principal interface{}) middleware.Responder {\n        return middleware.NotImplemented(\"operation find has not yet been implemented\")\n    })\n    api.UpdateOneHandler = todos.UpdateOneHandlerFunc(func(params todos.UpdateOneParams, principal interface{}) middleware.Responder {\n        return middleware.NotImplemented(\"operation updateOne has not yet been implemented\")\n    })\n\n    return setupGlobalMiddleware(api.Serve(setupMiddlewares))\n}\n\nWhen you look at the code for the configureAPI method then you'll notice that the api object has properties for consumers.\nA consumer is an object that can marshal things from a wireformat to an object.  Consumers and their counterpart producers who write objects get their names generated from the consumes and produces properties on a swagger specification.\nOften, this will be JSON. If you want to use XML, additionally you have to enable XML compatible models when generating the server. For that, you have to set the command options --default-consumes or --default-produces to an XML mime type like application/xml. For more details on using XML, also see the client generation.\nThe interface definitions for consumers and producers look like this:\n// ConsumerFunc represents a function that can be used as a consumer\ntype ConsumerFunc func(io.Reader, interface{}) error\n\n// Consume consumes the reader into the data parameter\nfunc (fn ConsumerFunc) Consume(reader io.Reader, data interface{}) error {\n    return fn(reader, data)\n}\n\n// Consumer implementations know how to bind the values on the provided interface to\n// data provided by the request body\ntype Consumer interface {\n    // Consume performs the binding of request values\n    Consume(io.Reader, interface{}) error\n}\n\n// ProducerFunc represents a function that can be used as a producer\ntype ProducerFunc func(io.Writer, interface{}) error\n\n// Produce produces the response for the provided data\nfunc (f ProducerFunc) Produce(writer io.Writer, data interface{}) error {\n    return f(writer, data)\n}\n\n// Producer implementations know how to turn the provided interface into a valid\n// HTTP response\ntype Producer interface {\n    // Produce writes to the http response\n    Produce(io.Writer, interface{}) error\n}\n\nSo it's something that can turn a reader into a hydrated interface. A producer is the counterpart of a consumer and writes objects to an io.Writer.  When you configure an api with those you make sure it can marshal the types for the supported content types.\nGo swagger automatically provides consumers and producers for known media types. To register a new mapping for a media\ntype or to override an existing mapping, call the corresponding API functions in your configure_xxx.go file:\nfunc configureAPI(api *operations.ToDoListAPI) http.Handler {\n    // other setup code here...\n\n    api.RegisterConsumer(\"application/pkcs10\", myCustomConsumer)\n    api.RegisterProducer(\"application/pkcs10\", myCustomProducer)\n}\n\nThe next thing that happens in the configureAPI method is setting up the authentication with a stub handler in this case. This particular swagger specification supports token based authentication and as such it wants you to configure a token auth handler.  Any error for an authentication handler is assumed to be an invalid authentication and will return the 401 status code.\n// UserPassAuthentication authentication function\ntype UserPassAuthentication func(string, string) (interface{}, error)\n\n// TokenAuthentication authentication function\ntype TokenAuthentication func(string) (interface{}, error)\n\n// AuthenticatorFunc turns a function into an authenticator\ntype AuthenticatorFunc func(interface{}) (bool, interface{}, error)\n\n// Authenticate authenticates the request with the provided data\nfunc (f AuthenticatorFunc) Authenticate(params interface{}) (bool, interface{}, error) {\n    return f(params)\n}\n\n// Authenticator represents an authentication strategy\n// implementations of Authenticator know how to authenticate the\n// request data and translate that into a valid principal object or an error\ntype Authenticator interface {\n    Authenticate(interface{}) (bool, interface{}, error)\n}\n\nSo we finally get to configuring our route handlers. For each operation there exists an interface so that implementations have some freedom to provide alternative implementations. For example mocks in certain tests, automatic stubbing handlers, not implemented handlers. Let's look at the addOne handler in a bit more detail.\n// AddOneHandlerFunc turns a function with the right signature into a add one handler\ntype AddOneHandlerFunc func(AddOneParams, interface{}) middleware.Responder\n\n// Handle executing the request and returning a response\nfunc (fn AddOneHandlerFunc) Handle(params AddOneParams, principal interface{}) middleware.Responder {\n    return fn(params, principal)\n}\n\n// AddOneHandler interface for that can handle valid add one params\ntype AddOneHandler interface {\n    Handle(AddOneParams, interface{}) middleware.Responder\n}\n\nBecause the addOne operation requires authentication, this interface definition requires 2 arguments. The first argument is about the request parameters and the second parameter is the security principal for the request.  In this case it is of type interface{}, typically that is a type like Account, User, Session, ...\nIt is your job to provide such a handler. Go swagger guarantees that by the time the request processing ends up at the handler, the parameters and security principal have been bound and validated.  So you can safely proceed with saving the request body to some persistence medium perhaps.\nThere is a context that gets created where the handlers get wired up into a http.Handler. For the add one this looks like this:\n// NewAddOne creates a new http.Handler for the add one operation\nfunc NewAddOne(ctx *middleware.Context, handler AddOneHandler) *AddOne {\n    return &AddOne{Context: ctx, Handler: handler}\n}\n\n/*AddOne swagger:route POST / todos addOne\n\nAddOne add one API\n\n*/\ntype AddOne struct {\n    Context *middleware.Context\n    Params  AddOneParams\n    Handler AddOneHandler\n}\n\nfunc (o *AddOne) ServeHTTP(rw http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    route, _ := o.Context.RouteInfo(r)\n\n    uprinc, err := o.Context.Authorize(r, route)\n    if err != nil {\n        o.Context.Respond(rw, r, route.Produces, route, err)\n        return\n    }\n    var principal interface{}\n    if uprinc != nil {\n        principal = uprinc\n    }\n\n    if err := o.Context.BindValidRequest(r, route, &o.Params); err != nil { // bind params\n        o.Context.Respond(rw, r, route.Produces, route, err)\n        return\n    }\n\n    res := o.Handler.Handle(o.Params, principal) // actually handle the request\n\n    o.Context.Respond(rw, r, route.Produces, route, res)\n\n}\n\nThe http.Handler implementation takes care of authentication, binding, user code execution and generating a response. For authentication this request would end up in the TokenAuthentication handler that was put on the api context object earlier.  When a request is authenticated it gets bound. This operation eventually requires an object that is an implementation of RequestBinder.  The AddOneParams are such an implementation:\n// RequestBinder is an interface for types to implement\n// when they want to be able to bind from a request\ntype RequestBinder interface {\n    BindRequest(*http.Request, *MatchedRoute) error\n}\n\n// AddOneParams contains all the bound params for the add one operation\n// typically these are obtained from a http.Request\n//\n// swagger:parameters addOne\ntype AddOneParams struct {\n    /*\n      In: body\n    */\n    Body *models.Item\n}\n\n// BindRequest both binds and validates a request, it assumes that complex things implement a Validatable(strfmt.Registry) error interface\n// for simple values it will use straight method calls\nfunc (o *AddOneParams) BindRequest(r *http.Request, route *middleware.MatchedRoute) error {\n    var res []error\n\n    var body models.Item\n    if err := route.Consumer.Consume(r.Body, &body); err != nil {\n        res = append(res, errors.NewParseError(\"body\", \"body\", \"\", err))\n    } else {\n        if err := body.Validate(route.Formats); err != nil {\n            res = append(res, err)\n        }\n\n        if len(res) == 0 {\n            o.Body = &body\n        }\n    }\n\n    if len(res) > 0 {\n        return errors.CompositeValidationError(res...)\n    }\n    return nil\n}\n\nIn this example there is only a body parameter, so we make use of the selected consumer to read the request body and turn it into an instance of models.Item. When the body parameter is bound, it gets validated and when validation passes no error is returned and the body property is set.  After a request is bound and validated the parameters and security principal are passed to the request handler. For this configuration that would return a 501 responder.\nGo swagger uses responders which are an interface implementation for things that can write to a response. For the generated server there are status code response and a default response object generated for every entry in the spec. For the addOne operation that are 2 objects one for the success case (201) and one for an error (default).\n// Responder is an interface for types to implement\n// when they want to be considered for writing HTTP responses\ntype Responder interface {\n    WriteResponse(http.ResponseWriter, runtime.Producer)\n}\n\n/*AddOneCreated Created\n\nswagger:response addOneCreated\n*/\ntype AddOneCreated struct {\n\n    // In: body\n    Payload *models.Item `json:\"body,omitempty\"`\n}\n\n// WriteResponse to the client\nfunc (o *AddOneCreated) WriteResponse(rw http.ResponseWriter, producer runtime.Producer) {\n\n    rw.WriteHeader(201)\n    if o.Payload != nil {\n        if err := producer.Produce(rw, o.Payload); err != nil {\n            panic(err) // let the recovery middleware deal with this\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n/*AddOneDefault error\n\nswagger:response addOneDefault\n*/\ntype AddOneDefault struct {\n\n    // In: body\n    Payload *models.Error `json:\"body,omitempty\"`\n}\n\n// WriteResponse to the client\nfunc (o *AddOneDefault) WriteResponse(rw http.ResponseWriter, producer runtime.Producer) {\n\n    rw.WriteHeader(500)\n    if o.Payload != nil {\n        if err := producer.Produce(rw, o.Payload); err != nil {\n            panic(err) // let the recovery middleware deal with this\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nSo an implementer of the AddOneHandler could return one of these 2 objects and go-swagger is able to respect the contract set forward by the spec document.\nSo to implement the AddOneHandler you could do something like this.\ntodos.AddOneHandlerFunc(func(params todos.AddOneParams, principal interface{}) middleware.Responder {\n  created, err := database.Save(params.Body)\n  if err != nil {\n    return AddOneDefault{models.Error{500, err.Error()}}\n  }\n  return AddOneCreated{created}\n})\n\n"},"use/server.html":{"url":"use/server.html","title":"How to use the server","keywords":"","body":"Use the generated server\nThe generated server serves the API but the default implementation returns 501 Not implemented for everything. Let's\nlook into using the generated code.\nGo swagger primarily deals with HTTP and originally only supports the stdlib net/http interface. A typical HTTP\nrequest expects a response.  This is reflected in go-swagger where a handler is typically defined as a function of\ninput parameters to a responder.\ntype ListTravelsHandler interface {\n    Handle(ListTravelsParams) middleware.Responder\n}\n\nThe signature of this handler is one of 2 possible variations. When a handler doesn't use authentication then a handler\ninterface consists out of input parameters and a responder.\ntype AddOneAuthenticatedHandler interface {\n    Handle(AddOneParams, interface{}) middleware.Responder\n}\n\nWhen a handler does use authentication then the second argument to the handler function represents the security\nprincipal for your application. You can specify the type name for this principal at generation time by specifying the\n-P or --principal flag.\nswagger generate server -P models.User\nswagger generate client -P models.User\nSee the full list of available options for server and for client.\nWhen you would execute the generate step with that parameter for the security principal then the\nAddOneAuthenticatedHandler would look a bit like this:\ntype AddOneAuthenticatedHandler interface {\n    Handle(AddOneParams, *models.User) middleware.Responder\n}\n\nImplement handlers\nA handler is an interface/contract that defines a statically typed representation of the input and output parameters of\nan operation on your API.\nThe tool generates handlers that are stubbed with a NotImplemented response when you first generate the server.\nThe not implemented handler\nThe not implemented handler is actually a not implemented responder, it returns a responder that will always respond\nwith status code 501 and a message that lets people know it's not the fault of the client that things don't work.\nmiddleware.NotImplemented(\"operation todos.AddOne has not yet been implemented\")\n\nYour own code\nEach HTTP request expects a response of some sort, this response might have no data but it's a response none the less.\nEvery incoming request is described as a bunch of input parameters which have been validated prior to calling the\nhandler. So whenever your code is executed, the input parameters are guaranteed to be valid according to what the\nswagger specification prescribes.\nAll the input parameters have been validated, and the request has been authenticated should it have triggered\nauthentication.\nYou probably want to return something a bit more useful to the users of your API than a not implemented response.\nA possible implementation of the ListTravelsHandler interface might look like this:\ntype PublicListTravelsOK struct {\n  Body []models.Travel\n}\nfunc (m *PublicListTravelsOK) WriteResponse(rw http.ResponseWriter, producer httpkit.Producer){\n  // generated code here\n}\n\ntype PublicListTravelsError struct {\n  Body models.Error\n}\nfunc (m *PublicListTravelsOK) WriteResponse(rw http.ResponseWriter, producer httpkit.Producer){\n  // generated code here\n}\n\ntype PublicListTravelsHandler struct {\n  db interface {\n    FetchTravels(*PublicListTravelsParams) ([]models.Travel, error)\n  }\n}\n\nfunc (m *PublicListTravelsHandler) Handle(params ListTravelsParams) middleware.Responder {\n  travels, err := m.db.FetchTravels(&params)\n  if err != nil {\n    return &PublicListTravelsError{Body: models.Error{Message: err.Error()}}\n  }\n  return &PublicListTravelsOK{Body: travels}\n}\n\nIn the example above we have a handler implementation with a hypothetical database fetch interface. When the handle\nmethod is executed there are 2 possible responses for the provided parameters. There can either be an error in which\ncase the PublicListTravelsError will be returned, otherwise the PublicListTravelsOK will be returned.\nThe code generator has written the remaining code to render that response with the headers etc.\n"},"generate/model.html":{"url":"generate/model.html","title":"Model Usage","keywords":"","body":"Generate models from a swagger spec\nUsage:\n  swagger [OPTIONS] generate model [model-OPTIONS]\n\ngenerate one or more models from the swagger spec\n\nApplication Options:\n  -q, --quiet                                                                     silence logs\n      --log-output=LOG-FILE                                                       redirect logs to file\n\nHelp Options:\n  -h, --help                                                                      Show this help message\n\n[model command options]\n      -n, --name=                                                                 the model to generate, repeat for multiple (defaults to all).

Go-swagger models are the go data structures used for serialization and validation.\nOf course none of this is possible without a set of rules and trade-offs.\nAbout schemas\nA schema is a data structure specified in a Swagger document. Loosely speaking, a swagger schema corresponds to\na JSONSchema-draft4 schema (see differences below).\nFor each schema, go-swagger will generate one or more model types in go.\n\nNOTE: Swagger makes a distinction between schemas and \"simple schemas\".\nWe use simple schemas to describe parameters and headers for operations.\nSimple schemas are supported by go-swagger (including validation), but are not rendered as standalone models.\nRather, simple schema structures and validation methods are generated with the operation they are attached to.\nModels are dedicated to the description of Swagger schemas, which are described as a parameter body, a response or a\nspec definition.\n\nInterfaces\nThe generated models implements:\n\na serialization interface\nMarshalJSON(), UnmarshalJSON():\nstandard structures use JSON decoder tags (serialization tags are customizable)\ncomposed and extensible structures use custom marshalers (allOf, additionalProperties, tuples and polymorphic types)\n\n\nMarshalBinary(), UnmarshalBinary() interfaces (encoding/BinaryMarshaler, encoding/BinaryUnmarshaler),\nwhich may use the fast mailru/easyjson package\n\n\na validation interface (go-openapi/runtime/Validatable), with a Validate(strfmt.Registry) error method\n\nValidation methods are wired at generation time, and rely mostly on native types: this makes validation faster than a\ndynamic general purpose JSON schema validator.\nExample of a generated structure:\n// Principal principal\n// swagger:model principal\ntype Principal struct {\n\n    // name\n    Name string `json:\"name,omitempty\"`\n\n    // roles\n    Roles []string `json:\"roles\"`\n}\n\n\nNOTE: if you are looking for a dynamic, fully JSONSchema compliant, general purpose validator,\nthe go-openapi/validate package\nis what you want. It is fully tested against the JSONSchema-Test-Suite (supports JSON-schema-draft4).\nSee a working example here.\n\nMapping patterns\nThe general idea is that you should rarely see interface{} in the generated code:\nyou get a complete representation of a swagger document in somewhat idiomatic go.\nThere is set of mapping patterns that are applied to transform a spec into go types:\n\ndefinition of primitive => type alias/name\ndefinition of array => type alias/name\ndefinition of map => type alias/name\ndefinition of object with properties => struct\ndefinition of $ref => type alias/name\nobject with only additional properties => map[string]T\nobject with additional properties and properties => custom serializer\nschema with schema array in items => tuple (struct with properties, custom serializer)\nschema with all of => struct\nall of schema with ref => embedded value\nall of schema with properties => properties are included in struct\nadding an all of schema with just x-isnullable: true or x-nullable: true turns\nthe schema into a pointer when there are only other extension properties provided\nadditional items in tuples =>\nJSONSchema and by extension swagger allow for items that have a fixed size array\nwith schema's describing the items at each index. This can be combined with additional items\nto form some kind of tuple with varargs.\nTo map this to go it creates a struct that has fixed names and a custom json serializer.\n\nMinimal use of go's reflection\nGenerated models uses no reflection except for enum and required validations. This makes validation faster.\nDoc strings\nAll documentation items provided by the spec are integrated as godoc-friendly comments in the\ngenerated source. You may look at how a trivial example is rendered here.\nThe code that is generated also gets the same doc comments that are used by the scanner\nto generate a spec from go code (e.g. comments like // swagger:xxx).\nSo that after generation you should be able to reverse-generate a spec from the code that was generated by your spec.\nIt should be equivalent to the original spec but might miss some default values and examples.\nTypes reusability\nModels can be generated independently from other components of your API.\nInternal model structures may thus be safely regenerated if the contract at your endpoints does not change.\nReusing previous generations\nPreviously generated models can be reused when constructing a new API server or client (e.g. using swagger generate server --model=[my existing package]).\nThe generator makes every effort to keep the go code readable, idiomatic and commented: models may thus be manually customized or extended.\nSuch customized types may be later on reused in other specs, using the x-go-type extension.\nSwagger vs JSONSchema\nA Swagger 2.0 schema corresponds by and large to a JSON-schema-draft4. However, there are some substantial differences (see swagger):\nIn JSONSchema, but not in Swagger 2.0:\n\nanyOf, oneOf and not constructs are not supported (this is for OpenAPI 3)\nthe null type is not supported (the nullable keyword is defined in OpenAPI 3)\nadditionalItems are not supported (go-swagger does support it)\npatternProperties are not supported\ndependencies are not supported\nmultiple types, defined as type: [ ... ] are not supported\n\nConversely, what we have in Swagger 2.0, but not in JSON-schema:\n\nthe discriminator attribute controls polymorphism (see below)\nproperties may be given a readOnly attribute (same as in JSONSchema-draft7)\narray types must have an items restriction\nformat supports more values for strings and numbers\n\nOther minor differences:\n\ndefault values must validate their schema\ntypes array must have an items specification\nextensions may be specified as special x-... annotations. Go-swagger defines some custom tags to customize generated code.\nother available attributes: example, xml and externalDocs\n\n\nNOTE: example and externalDocs do not currently influence models generation.\n\nGo-swagger vs Swagger\ngo-swagger models implements almost all Swagger 2.0 schema features.\nWe also wanted to support as much JSONSchema features as possible: the model generator may be used independently\nto generate data structures using the Swagger specification as a serialization description language.\nThere are some small differences or implementation details to be aware of.\n\n\n\nFeature\nJSON-schema-draft4\nSwagger 2.0\ngo-swagger\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\"format\"\nY\nY\nY\nFormats are provided by the extensible go-openapi/strfmt package.

In cases where this is\nimportant, use the x-nullable extension\nusing null as a proxy for unset, makes uneasy the explicit use of the JSON null type\nSwagger APIs are not supposed to carry null values.\ngo-swagger generated APIs can, using the x-nullable extension, and it is then not possible\nto distinguish a field explicitly set to null from an unset field\n\nAn alternate design has been experimented but not released. For those interested in pushing forward this project again,\nsee this pull request\n\nCommon use cases\nYou don't always have to resort to pointers to figure out whether a value is empty.\n\nThe idiomatic way to check for a null/empty string is: minLength: 1\n\nValidation\nAll produced models implement the Validatable interface.\nExceptions:\n\nfile types do not support validation (however generated operations may check the maxLength of a file)\nempty schemas (any type, rendered as interface{}) do not support validation\n\nTherefore, type aliases constructed on either a swagger file or an empty schema does not implement this interface.\nValidation errors:\n\nReturned errors are supported by the go-openapi/errors/Error type, which supports errors codes and composite errors.\n\nValidation stops assessing errors down to the property level and does not continue digging all nested strutures as soon\nas an error is found.\nType aliasing\nA definition may create an aliased type like this:\ndefinitions:\n  myDate:\n    type: string\n    format: date\n\nRendered as:\ntype MyDate strfmt.Date\n\nNotice that setting x-nullable: true in such an alias will not render the type itself into a pointer, but rather,\nall containers of his type will use it as a pointer.\nExample:\ndefinitions:\n  myDate:\n    type: string\n    format: date\n    x-nullable: true\n  anArrayOfDates:\n    type: array\n    items:\n      $ref: '#/definitions/myDate'\n\nYields:\ntype MyDate strfmt.Date\n...\ntype AnArrayOfDates []*MyDate\n\nRealiasing\nGiven the above definitions, we add:\n  ...\n  herDate:\n    $ref: #/definitions/myDate\n  hisDate:\n    $ref: #/definitions/herDate\n\nRendered as (requires go1.9+):\ntype HerDate = MyDate\n\ntype HisDate = HerDate\n\nExtensible types\nObjects and additional properties\nAdditional properties in a JSON object are represented in a go struct by map[string]T.\nExamples:\ndefinitions:\n  extensibleObject:\n    properties:\n      prop1:\n        type:  integer\n    additionalProperties:\n      type: string\n      format: date\n\nIs rendered as:\ntype ExtensibleObject struct {\n    Prop1 int64\n    ExtensibleObjectProperties map[string]strfmt.Date\n}\n\nIf there is no restriction on the additional properties:\ndefinitions:\n  extensibleObject:\n    type: object\n    properties:\n      prop1:\n        type: integer\n    additionalProperties: true\n\nWe get:\ntype ExtensibleObject struct {\n    Prop1 int64\n    ExtensibleObjectProperties map[string]interface{}\n}\n\nTuples and additional items\nA tuple is rendered as a structure with a property for each element of the tuple.\nExample:\ndefinitions:\n  tuple:\n    type: array\n    items:\n    - type: integer\n    - type: string\n    - type: string\n      format: uuid\n\nGives:\ntype Tuple struct {\n    P0 *int64\n    P1 *string\n    P2 *strfmt.UUID\n}\n\nIf we specify additional items as in:\ndefinitions:\n  extensibleTuple:\n    type: array\n    items:\n    - type: integer\n    - type: string\n    - type: string\n      format: uuid\n    additionalItems:\n    - type: number\n\nGives:\ntype ExtensibleTuple struct {\n    P0 *int64\n    P1 *string\n    P2 *strfmt.UUID\n    ExtensibleTupleItems []float64\n}\n\n\nNOTE: currently the P0, P1, ... names are not customizable.\n\nPolymorphic types\nPolymorphic types are swagger's flavor for inheritance (aka hierarchized composition...).\nThe use of the discriminator keyword gives a special meaning to allOf compositions.\nBase types\nWhenever the special attribute discriminator is used, this means this object definition is\na base type, to be used to extend other types, or subtypes.\nThe discriminator property indicates which subtype is used whenever an instance of the base type is found.\nThe discriminator's possible values are the names of the subtypes (no aliasing is supported in Swagger 2.0).\n\nNOTE: the discriminator is a required property with \"type\": \"string\".\nNo validation attached to this property, save required, will be honored, as\na discriminator property is implicitly an enum with all the subtype names found in the spec.\n\nThe base type must be a JSON-schema object (it has at least one property, the discriminator).\nIt may define other properties than the discriminator. Like name in this example.\nExample:\n  Pet:\n    type: object\n    discriminator: petType\n    properties:\n      name:\n        type: string\n      petType:\n        type: string\n    required:\n    - name\n    - petType\n\nA base type is rendered as an interface, with getter/setter funcs on all attributes.\n// Pet pet\n// swagger:discriminator Pet petType\ntype Pet interface {\n    runtime.Validatable\n\n    // name\n    // Required: true\n    Name() *string\n    SetName(*string)\n\n    // pet type\n    // Required: true\n    PetType() string\n    SetPetType(string)\n}\n\n\nNOTE: an unexported reference concrete type is also generated, but not currently used by models.\n\nSubtypes\nA subtype extends a base type. It is defined by composing the base type with an allOf construct.\nAll subtypes implement the interface of their base type. So in this examples, all instances of Dog may pretend\nto be a Pet.\nExample:\n  Dog:\n    type: object\n    description: A representation of a dog\n    allOf:\n    - $ref: '#/definitions/Pet'\n    - properties:\n        packSize:\n          type: integer\n          format: int32\n          description: the size of the pack the dog is from\n          default: 0\n          minimum: 0\n      required:\n      - packSize\n\nYields:\n// Dog A representation of a dog\n// swagger:model Dog\ntype Dog struct {\n    nameField *string\n\n    // the size of the pack the dog is from\n    // Required: true\n    // Minimum: 0\n    PackSize *int32 `json:\"packSize\"`\n}\n\n// Name gets the name of this subtype\nfunc (m *Dog) Name() *string {\n    return m.nameField\n}\n\n// SetName sets the name of this subtype\nfunc (m *Dog) SetName(val *string) {\n    m.nameField = val\n}\n\n// PetType gets the pet type of this subtype\nfunc (m *Dog) PetType() string {\n    return \"Dog\"\n}\n\n// SetPetType sets the pet type of this subtype\nfunc (m *Dog) SetPetType(val string) {\n\n}\n\nNotice the unexported fields which correspond to the description of the base type.\nThe properties of the base type are available with getter/setter functions.\n\nNOTE: if you expand your spec, the allOf semantics are lost.\nDo not expand specs with polymorphic types for code generation.\n\nYou may define several such derived types.\nExample:\n  cat:\n    type: object\n    description: A representation of a cat\n    allOf:\n    - $ref: '#/definitions/Pet'\n    - properties:\n        huntingSkill:\n          type: string\n          description: The measured skill for hunting\n          default: lazy\n          enum:\n          - clueless\n          - lazy\n          - adventurous\n          - aggressive\n      required:\n      - huntingSkill\n\n// Cat A representation of a cat\n// swagger:model cat\ntype Cat struct {\n    nameField *string\n\n    // The measured skill for hunting\n    // Required: true\n    // Enum: [clueless lazy adventurous aggressive]\n    HuntingSkill *string `json:\"huntingSkill\"`\n}\n\n// Name gets the name of this subtype\nfunc (m *Cat) Name() *string {\n    return m.nameField\n}\n\n// SetName sets the name of this subtype\nfunc (m *Cat) SetName(val *string) {\n    m.nameField = val\n}\n\n// PetType gets the pet type of this subtype\nfunc (m *Cat) PetType() string {\n    return \"cat\"\n}\n\n// SetPetType sets the pet type of this subtype\nfunc (m *Cat) SetPetType(val string) {\n\n}\n\nNotice that the value of the discriminator field is case sensitive, e.g. \"Dog\" and \"cat\" above.\nType composition\nBase types and subtypes may be used in other constructs. While subtypes are mostly handled like ordinary objects,\nthere are special provisions taken to generate new types composing base types.\nExample:\n  Kennel:\n    type: object\n    required:\n      - pets\n    properties:\n      id:\n        type: integer\n        format: int64\n      pets:          # \nYields:\n// Kennel kennel\n// swagger:model Kennel\ntype Kennel struct {\n\n    // id\n    ID int64 `json:\"id,omitempty\"`\n\n    petsField []Pet\n}\n\n// Pets gets the pets of this base type\nfunc (m *Kennel) Pets() []Pet {\n    return m.petsField\n}\n\n// SetPets sets the pets of this base type\nfunc (m *Kennel) SetPets(val []Pet) {\n    m.petsField = val\n}\n\n\nNOTE: this representation with unexported fields for references to base types might be subject to change in\nthe future, as it is not consistent in all cases. If you are intested to participate this design work,\nfeel free to comment and express your views here.\n\nFactories for base types\nSubtypes and composed types have custom [un]marshallers.\nUnmarshalling a base type is not carried through the standard MarshalJSON()/UnmarshalJSON() pair, but with\nfactories created for each base type.\nExample:\n// UnmarshalPet unmarshals polymorphic Pet\nfunc UnmarshalPet(reader io.Reader, consumer runtime.Consumer) (Pet, error)\n\n// UnmarshalPetSlice unmarshals polymorphic slices of Pet\nfunc UnmarshalPetSlice(reader io.Reader, consumer runtime.Consumer) ([]Pet, error)\n\nNote that the marshalling of a base type into JSON is processed naturally, so there is no need for a special function.\n\nKnown limitations:\nAs of v0.15, there are still some known limitations:\n\nUnmarshalling maps of base types is not supported at the moment (e.g. UnmarshalPetMap() factory)\nMore complex constructs like [][]Pet, []map[string]Pet are not supported yet\ncomposing tuples containing base types is not supported yet\n\n\nSerialization interfaces\n\nCustom serializers\nTags are generally sufficient to provide proper JSON marshalling capabilities.\nModels define some custom [un]marshallers in the following situations:\n\ntuples: array elements are dispatched in the tuple's struct\nadditionalProperties: additional content is dispatched in the map[string]...\nsubtypes of base types\ntypes composed of base types\naliases on formatted types when the underlying type is not string (e.g. Date, Datetime)\n\n\n\nExternal types\nExternal types refer to custom type definitions, short-circuiting the use of generated models.\nThis is helpful for use-cases when custom marshaling or validation is needed.\nModels may also be generated once, customized manually, then reused in spec as external types.\nThe extension annotation to declare an external type is x-go-type.\nA complete example is provided here\nto illustrate the different capabilities to inject custom types.\nExamples:\nExternal types are typically used in top-level model definitions, like so:\ndefinitions:\n  myType:\n    type: object\n    x-go-type:\n      type: MyExternalType                          # \nSuch definitions do not produce any generated model.\nReferences in the generated code to this type will produce code like this:\ncustom.MyExternalType\n\nIf no package is provided, it defaults to the models package indicated for codegen:\ndefinitions:\n  generatedType:\n    type: array\n    items:\n      $ref: '#/definitions/myType'\n\n  myType:\n    type: object\n    x-go-type:\n      type: MyExternalType\n\nswagger generate models --model-package custom --target ./codegen\n\nls ./codegen/custom   # \npackage custom\n\ntype GeneratedType []MyType\n\nExternal types may also be injected at lower schema levels:\ndefinitions:\n  MyType:\n    type: array\n    items:\n      type: string\n      x-go-type:\n        type: MyExternalString\n        import:\n          package: github.com/example/models/custom\n\nor:\n  MyObject:\n    type: object\n    properties:\n      p1:\n        x-go-type:\n          type: RawMessage\n          import:\n            package: encoding/json\n          hints:\n            kind: interface\n\nThis also works for inlined types defined at the operation level:\n  parameters:\n  - in: body\n    name: corpus\n    schema:\n      type: object\n      x-go-type:\n        type: MyExternalStruct\n        import:\n          package: github.com/example/models/custom\n\n\nNOTE: when defining inline arrays or maps, you should know that the external type is\nnot considered nullable by default.\nTherefore, unless you explicitly hint the generator to consider it nullable, you'll\nget constructs such as []external.MyType or map[string]external.MyType instead of []*external.MyType\nand map[string]*external.MyType respectively. You can use the nullable hint or the x-nullable extension\nto control this behavior.\n\nKnown limitations\n\nExternal types only apply to schema objects. Simple swagger types\nused in operations for query or path parameters or for response headers\ncannot be externalized at this moment.\n\nInlined external types cannot be declared inside polymorphic types (discriminated types).\n\nInlined external types cannot be declared as embedded. Only top-level definitions are supported.\n\n\nExternal package aliasing\nThe following example replaces all references to myModel by github.com/example/models/MyCustomModel.\nExample:\ndefinitions:\n  myModel:\n    type: object\n    x-go-type:\n      type: MyCustomModel\n      import:\n        package: github.com/example/models\n\nNote that the external model must implement the github.com/go-openapi/runtime.Validatable interface: it must know how to validate a schema.\nNo model is generated for this definition.\nExternal packages may be imported with an alias, like so:\n  parameters:\n    in: body\n    schema:\n      type: object\n      x-go-type:\n        type: MyExternalStruct\n        import:\n          package: github.com/example/models/custom\n          alias: fred\n\nImports will look like so:\nimport (\n  fred \"github.com/example/models/custom\"\n)\n...\n\nSome deconfliction with other known import is applied automatically. Automatic deconfliction is not perfect, though.\nFor example:\n  MyObject:\n    type: object\n    properties:\n      p1:\n        x-go-type:\n          type: RawMessage\n          import:\n            package: encoding/json\n          hints:\n            kind: interface\n\nimport (\n  jsonext \"encoding/json\"\n)\n\nEmbedding external types\nSometimes, it is impractical to impose the constraint that the external type has a validation method.\nYou can then use the \"embedded\" option to create an embedded type based on the external model, and wraps the Validate\nmethod.\nExample:\ndefinitions:\n  Time:\n    type: string\n    format: date-time         # \nThis example generates a wrapper type in the package model with a Validate method like this:\nimport (\n    timeext \"time\"\n\n    \"github.com/go-openapi/runtime\"\n    \"github.com/go-openapi/strfmt\"\n    \"github.com/go-openapi/swag\"\n)\n\n// Time time\n//\n// swagger:model Time\ntype Time struct {\n    timeext.Time\n}\n\nfunc (m Time) Validate(formats strfmt.Registry) error {\n    var f interface{} = m.Time\n    if v, ok := f.(runtime.Validatable); ok {\n        return v.Validate(formats)\n    }\n    return nil\n}\n\nThe generated Validate method uses any existing Validate method or just returns nil (i.e. data is valid).\n\nNOTE: at the moment, we do not support the format specification over the embedded type. Format will be documentary only in that case.\n\nOther examples:\n  Raw:\n    x-go-type:\n      type: RawMessage\n      import:\n        package: encoding/json\n      hints:\n        kind: primitive\n      embedded: true\n\nimport (\n ...\n jsonext \"encoding/json\"\n ...\n)\n\ntype Raw struct {\n    jsonext.RawMessage\n}\n\nfunc (m Raw) Validate(formats strfmt.Registry) error {\n    var f interface{} = m.RawMessage\n    if v, ok := f.(runtime.Validatable); ok {\n        return v.Validate(formats)\n    }\n    return nil\n}\n\nYou can embed types as pointers just the same.\nExample:\ndefinitions:\n  Time:\n    type: string\n    x-go-type:\n      type: Time\n      import:\n        package: time\n      hints:\n        nullable: true  # \ntype Time struct {\n    *time.Time\n}\n\nUsing external types is powerful, but normally you still have to describe your type in the specification. That is expected,\nsince this is how you document your API.\nIf you don't (that is the type referred to doesn't correspond to the type in the spec), then the generator may fail to produce correct code,\nbecause it simply has no way to infer what kind of object is being referred to.\nTo solve this kind of problem, you may hint the generator to produce a correct usage of the external types, even though the specification\ndoesn't reflect the correct nature of the object.\nExample:\ndefinitions:\n  Error:\n    type: object\n\n  Hotspot:\n    x-go-type:\n      type: Hotspot\n      import:\n        package: github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/fixtures/enhancements/2224/external\n      hints:\n        kind: object\n    x-nullable: true\n\nIn this example, the Hotspot schema is empty in the specification. The generator therefore can only guess that this is some interface{} type.\nNow thanks to the hint kind: object, we instruct the generator to expect an object so as to correctly reference this object.\nValidation of external types\nBy default, the generator assumes that external types can be validated and will generate code that calls the \"Validate\"\nmethod of the type.\nThis can be disabled  by providing an explicit hint:\n  MyObject:\n    type: object\n    properties:\n      p1:\n        x-go-type:\n          type: RawMessage\n          import:\n            package: encoding/json\n          hints:\n            noValidation: true\n\nExternal types with an hint type \"interface\" or \"stream\" do not call validations.\nEmbedded types use type assertion to dynamically determine if the external type implements the runtime.Validatable interface.\nExternal type hints\nThe generator does not attempt to introspect external types. They may even not exist at generation time.\nTherefore, the generator has no idea of whether it is safe to generate pointers to the external type.\nBy default, external types are considered non nullable. This can be altered with the nullable hint or\nby hinting a type that is considered nullable (such as \"object\").\nSupported hints:\n        x-go-type:\n          type: {external type name (exported symbol, without package qualifier)}\n          import:\n            package: {fully qualified package name - defaults to the target models defined by the --model-package flag}\n          hints:\n            kind: {map|object|array|interface|primitive|tuple|stream}\n            noValidation: true|false  # \nCaveats with imports\nAt this moment, external packages and aliases are deconflicted against other known imports and variables.\nExample:\n  MyObject:\n    type: object\n    properties:\n      p1:\n        x-go-type:\n          type: RawMessage\n          import:\n            package: encoding/json\n          hints:\n            kind: interface\n\nwill generate an import deconflicted against the standard lib import:\nimport(\n    ...\n    jsonext \"encoding/json\"\n    ...\n    )\n\nExternal package aliasing\nExternal packages may be imported with an alias, like so:\n  parameters:\n    in: body\n    schema:\n      type: object\n      x-go-type:\n        type: MyExternalStruct\n        import:\n          package: github.com/example/models/custom\n          alias: fred\n\nImports will look like so:\nimport (\n  fred \"github.com/example/models/custom\"\n)\n...\n\nSome deconfliction with other known imports is applied automatically. Automatic deconfliction is not perfect, though.\nFor example:\n  MyObject:\n    type: object\n    properties:\n      p1:\n        x-go-type:\n          type: RawMessage\n          import:\n            package: encoding/json\n          hints:\n            kind: interface\n\nimport (\n  jsonext \"encoding/json\"\n)\n\nPackage aliases may still conflict with packages produces by operation tags or other external imports.\nIn such cases, modify the type alias under x-go-type to resolve the conflict manually.\nCustomizing struct tags\nWhen a model struct is generated, tags for json are generated to keep the original name:\ntype ObjectWithTag struct {\n    StandardTag string `json:\"standardTag,omitempty\"`\n}\n\nExtra tags\nExtra tags may be defined with the CLI generation option --sruct-tags.\nExtra tags essentially repeat the name of the field can be added from the command line option.\n\nNOTE: at this moment, all tag modifiers (omitempty, string) are repeated like for the json tag.\n\nswagger generate model ... --struct-tags yaml,db\n\ntype ObjectWithTag struct {\n    StandardTag string `json:\"standardTag,omitempty\" yaml:\"standardTag,omitempty\" db:\"standardTag,omitempty\"`\n}\n\nCustom tags\nA custom may be added to a field using the x-go-custom-tag extension. Like so:\nOmit empty values\nBy default, a struct field is omitted when it holds the zero value (tag modifier: omitempty).\nRequired fields are never omitted.\ntype ObjectWithTag struct {\n    RequiredField *string `json:\"requiredField\"`\n}\n\nThis property can be altered using the x-omitempty extension. Like so:\nobjectWithTag:\n  type: object\n  properties:\n    field:\n      type: string\n      x-omitempty: false\n\ntype ObjectWithTag struct {\n    Field string `json:\"field\"`\n}\n\nThe extension does not force a required field to get the \"omitempty\" modifier.\nNumerical values as string\nFor some specific requirements, the standard json library may consider numbers as strings.\nThis is done by adding the modifier json:\"...,string\" to the tag.\nWith go-swagger you can specify this modifier by adding the x-go-json-string: true extension to your type.\ntype ObjectWithTag struct {\n    NumericField int `json:\"field,omitempty,string\"`\n}\n\nXML tags\nThe XML name and attribute Swagger properties are used to generate extra tags.\ndefinitions:\n objectWithXML:\n   type: object\n   properties:\n     field:\n       type: string\n       xml:\n         name: xmlObject\n         attribute: true\n\ntype ObjectWithXML struct {\n    Field string `json:\"field,omitempty\" xml:\"xmlObject,attr,omitempty\"`\n}\n\nThe example tag\nIf you add example to the list of generated tags from the CLI (swagger generate ... --struct-tags example),\na special example tag is created with the example value taken from the specification.\ndefinitions:\n  objectWithExample:\n   properties:\n     field:\n       type: string\n       example: \"sample\"\n\ntype ObjectWithExample struct {\n    Field string `json:\"field,omitempty\" example:\"\\\"sample\\\"\"`\n}\n\nThe description tag\nIf you add description to the list of generated tags from the CLI (swagger generate ... --struct-tags description),\na special description tag is created with the description value taken from the specification.\ndefinitions:\n  objectWithDescription:\n   properties:\n     field:\n       type: string\n       description: \"some description\"\n\ntype ObjectWithDescription struct {\n    Field string `json:\"field,omitempty\" description:\"\\\"some description\\\"\"`\n}\n\n"},"generate/spec.html":{"url":"generate/spec.html","title":"Spec Usage","keywords":"","body":"Generate a spec from source code\nUsage:\n  swagger [OPTIONS] generate spec [spec-OPTIONS]\n\ngenerate a swagger spec document from a go application\n\nApplication Options:\n  -q, --quiet                  silence logs\n      --log-output=LOG-FILE    redirect logs to file\n\nHelp Options:\n  -h, --help                   Show this help message\n\n[spec command options]\n      -w, --work-dir=          the base path to use (default: .)\n      -t, --tags=              build tags\n      -m, --scan-models        includes models that were annotated with 'swagger:model'\n          --compact            when present, doesn't prettify the json\n      -o, --output=            the file to write to\n      -i, --input=             an input swagger file with which to merge\n      -c, --include=           include packages matching pattern\n      -x, --exclude=           exclude packages matching pattern\n          --include-tag=       include routes having specified tags (can be specified many times)\n          --exclude-tag=       exclude routes having specified tags (can be specified many times)\n          --exclude-deps       exclude all dependencies of project\nSee code annotation rules here\n"},"use/spec.html":{"url":"use/spec.html","title":"Spec generation rules","keywords":"","body":"swagger.json generation\nThe toolkit has a command that will let you generate a swagger spec document from your code.\nThe command integrates with go doc comments, and makes use of structs when it needs to know of\ntypes.\nBased on the work from https://github.com/yvasiyarov/swagger.\nIt uses a similar approach but with expanded annotations and it produces a swagger 2.0 spec.\nThe goal of the syntax is to make it look as a natural part of the documentation for the application code.\nThe generator is passed a main package and it uses that to discover all the code in use.\nTo do this it makes use of go's loader package. The same package that is used by tools like goimports to discover which files to format.\nOnce the parser has encountered a comment that matches on of its known tags, the parser will assume that the rest of the comment block is for swagger.\nIf it is your first time using this library for generating swagger \nspecification, you can also take a look at \nthis getting started guide\non Medium to get the big picture and then return here to read more \nabout all annotations and commands provided by this package.\nUsage\nTo generate a spec:\nswagger generate spec -o ./swagger.json\nSee the full list of available options here.\nYou give it a main file and it will parse all the files that are reachable by that main\npackage to produce a swagger specification.\nTo use you can add a go:generate comment to your main file for example:\n//go:generate swagger generate spec\nThe command requires a main package or file and it wants your code to compile. It uses the go tools loader to load an application and then scans all the packages that are in use by the code base.\nThis means that for something to be discoverable it needs to be reachable by a code path triggered through the main package.\nIf an annotation is not yet supported or you want to merge with a pre-existing spec, you can use the -i parameter.\nswagger generate spec -i ./swagger.yml -o ./swagger.json\nThe idea is that there are certain things that are more easily expressed by just using yaml\nTo generate spec in yaml format, just name the output file with \".yml\" or \".yaml\" extension. For example:\nswagger generate spec -o ./swagger.yml\nIf you don't want to generate Go language specific extensions in the spec file, you can disable them by doing\nSWAGGER_GENERATE_EXTENSION=false && swagger generate spec -o ./swagger.yml\nParsing rules\nThis command relies heavily on the way godoc works.\nThis means you should be very aware of all the things godoc supports.\n\ngodoc documenting go code\ngodoc ToHTML\ncommenting go effectively\ngodoc documentation\n\nSingle page which documents all the currently supported godoc rules:\n\ngodoc tricks\n\nThe generated code tries to avoid golint errors.\n\ngo lint\ngo lint style guide\n\nWhen an object has a title and a description field, it will use the go rules to parse those. So the first line of the\ncomment block will become the title, or a header when rendered as godoc. The rest of the comment block will be treated\nas description up to either the end of the comment block, or a line that starts with a known annotation.\nAnnotation syntax\nIf you want to exclude something from the spec generation process you can try with the struct tag: json:\"-\"\nThere are several annotations that mark a comment block as a participant for the swagger spec.\n\nswagger:meta\nswagger:route\nswagger:parameters\nswagger:response\nswagger:operation\nswagger:model\nswagger:allOf\nswagger:strfmt\nswagger:discriminated\nswagger:ignore\n\nEmbedded types\nFor the embedded schemas there are a set of rules for the spec generator to vary the definition it generates.\nWhen an embedded type isn't decorated with the swagger:allOf annotation, then the properties from the embedded value will be included in the generated definition as if they were defined on the definition. But when the embedded type is decorated with the swagger:allOf annotation then the all of element will be defined as a \"$ref\" property instead. For an annotated type there is also the possibility to specify an argument, the value of this argument will be used as the value for the x-class extension. This allows for generators that support the\nx-class extension to reliably build a serializer for a type with a discriminator\nKnown vendor extensions\nThere are a couple of commonly used vendor extensions that most frameworks support to add functionality to the swagger spec.\nFor generating a swagger specification document this toolkit supports:\n\n\n\nVendor extension\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nx-isnullable\nmakes a property value nullable, for go code that means a pointer\n\n\nx-nullable\nmakes a property value nullable, for go code that means a pointer\n\n\nx-go-name\nthe go name of a type\n\n\nx-go-package\nthe go package of a type\n\n\nx-class\nthis is used in conjunction with discriminators to give a full type name\n\n\nx-omitempty\nthis is used to control presence of omitempty tag to be used by JSON Marshaler. if the field is required, this extension doesn't take effect\n\n\nx-go-enum-ci\nmake a string enumeration case-insensitive\n\n\n\n"},"use/spec/meta.html":{"url":"use/spec/meta.html","title":"swagger:meta","keywords":"","body":"swagger:meta\nThe swagger:meta annotation flags a file as source for metadata about the API.\nThis is typically a doc.go file with your package documentation.\nYou can specify a Consumes and Produces key which has a new content type on each line\nSchemes is a tag that is required and allows for a comma separated string composed of:\nhttp, https, ws or wss\nHost and BasePath can be specified but those values will be defaults,\nthey should get substituted when serving the swagger spec.\nThe description property uses the rest of the comment block as description for the api when not explicitly provided\nSyntax:\nswagger:meta\nProperties:\n\n\n\nAnnotation\nFormat\n\n\n\n\nTermsOfService\nallows for either a url or a free text definition describing the terms of services for the API (alias \"TOS\")\n\n\nConsumes\na list of default (global) mime type values, one per line, for the content the API receives.List of supported mime types\n\n\nProduces\na list of default (global) mime type values, one per line, for the content the API sends.List of supported mime types\n\n\nSchemes\na list of default schemes the API accept (possible values: http, https, ws, wss) https is preferred as default when configured\n\n\nVersion\nthe current version of the API\n\n\nHost\nthe host from where the spec is served\n\n\nBase path\nthe default base path for this API\n\n\nContact\nthe name of for the person to contact concerning the API eg.

That field will be used as discriminator field when marshalling/unmarshalling objects.\nBecause this is for use with interfaces we can't make use of the json struct tag to allow for spec name overriding.

That means that for any supported transport by the toolkit you can reuse any middleware existing middlewares that following the stdlib middleware pattern.\n\nThere are several projects providing middleware libraries for weaving all kinds of functionality into your request handling. None of those things are the job of go-swagger, go-swagger just serves your specs.\nThe server takes care of a number of things when a request arrives:\n\nrouting\nauthentication\ninput validation\ncontent negotiation\nparameter and body binding\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the concept of golang net/http middlewares you can read up on it here:Making and Using HTTP Middleware\nBesides serving the swagger specification as an API, the toolkit also serves the actual swagger specification document.\nThe convention is to use the /swagger.json location for serving up the specification document, so we serve the\nspecification at that path.\nAdd middleware\nThe generated server allows for 3 extension points to inject middleware in its middleware chain. These have to do with\nthe lifecycle of a request. You can find those hooks in the configure_xxx_api.go file.\nThe first one is to add middleware all the way to the top of the middleware stack. To do this you add them in the\nsetupGlobalMiddleware method. This middleware applies to everything in the go-swagger managed API.\nfunc setupGlobalMiddleware(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {\n    return handler\n}\n\nThe second extension point allows for middleware to be injected right before actually handling a matched request.\nThis excludes the swagger.json document from being affected by this middleware though.  This extension point makes the\nmiddlewares execute right after routing but right before authentication, binding and validation.  You add middlewares\nto this point by editing the setupMiddlewares method in configure_xxx_api.go\nfunc setupMiddlewares(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {\n    return handler\n}\n\nThe third point allows you to set the middleware for existing handler by its route and HTTP method. It can be done in the configureAPI function by calling api.AddMiddlewareFor method.\nfunc configureAPI(api *operations.SomeAPI) http.Handler {\n    api.AddMiddlewareFor('GET', '/', customMiddlewareFunc)\n}\n\nThe global middleware is an excellent place to do things like panic handling, request logging or adding metrics.  While\nthe plain middleware allows you to kind of filter this by request path without having to take care of routing. You also\nget access to the full context that the go-swagger toolkit uses throughout the lifecycle of a request.\nAdd logging and panic handling\nA very common requirement for HTTP APIs is to include some form of logging. Another one is to handle panics from your\nAPI requests.  The example for a possible implementation of this uses this community provided\nmiddleware to catch panics.\nfunc setupGlobalMiddleware(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {\n  recovery := recover.New(&recover.Options{\n    Log: log.Print,\n  })\n  return recovery(handler)\n}\n\nThere are tons of middlewares out there, some are framework specific and some frameworks don't really use the plain\nvanilla golang net/http as base abstraction. For those you can use a project like interpose that serves as an adapter\nlayer so you can still reuse middlewares. Of course nobody is stopping you to just implement your own middlewares.\nFor example using interpose to integrate with logrus.\nimport (\n  interpose \"github.com/carbocation/interpose/middleware\"\n)\nfunc setupGlobalMiddleware(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {\n  logViaLogrus := interpose.NegroniLogrus()\n  return logViaLogrus(handler)\n}\n\nAnd you can compose these middlewares into a stack using functions.\nfunc setupGlobalMiddleware(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {\n  handlePanic := recover.New(&recover.Options{\n    Log: log.Print,\n  })\n\n  logViaLogrus := interpose.NegroniLogrus()\n\n  return handlePanic(\n    logViaLogrus(\n      handler\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nAdd rate limiting\nYou can also add rate limiting in a similar way. Let's say we just want to rate limit the valid requests to our swagger\nAPI. To do so we could use tollbooth.\nfunc setupMiddlewares(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {\n  limiter := tollbooth.NewLimiter(1, time.Second)\n  limiter.IPLookups = []string{\"RemoteAddr\", \"X-Forwarded-For\", \"X-Real-IP\"}\n    return tollbooth.LimitFuncHandler(handler)\n}\n\nAnd with this you've added rate limiting to your application.\nAdd middleware to certain routes\nYou can add standard net/http middleware to certain routes.\nfunc myMiddleware(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {\n    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request){\n            // do some middleware logic here\n            handler.ServeHTTP(w, r)\n        })\n}\n\n...\napi.AddMiddlewareFor(\"POST\", \"/example\", myMiddleware)\n\n"},"use/template_layout.html":{"url":"use/template_layout.html","title":"Custom generation","keywords":"","body":"Custom generation\nTo completely customize the templates that are being considered, their file names and paths, go-swagger allows you to pass in a configuration file.\nThere are basically 4 types of items that are being generated:\n\nModels\nOperations\nOperation groups (tagged groups of operations)\nApplication\n\nYou provide a configuration that describes the type of template, the source for where to find the template.

The code generator will respect this.\nYou might use both, preparing a customized model from an initially generated structure, then reusing type custom type in other declarations by hinting the generator with x-go-type.\nFurther, for repetitive customization, you might be willing to customize the generator's templates. Like in here\nfor models, or in here for inline parameters.\nOriginally from issues #997 and #1334\nNon-required or nullable property?\nUse-Case: when a definition has a property N, if N is a number and is not required,\nthe corresponding generated model has the struct flag omitempty for N.\nThis means that when N has been set to 0 the generated JSON omits N, despite it being validly set to 0.\nI would still like to allow this variable to be unset, by setting it to null for example.\nThis will also apply for returning objects that return false and so on.\n\nThe \"omitempty\" option specifies that the field should be omitted from the encoding if the field has an empty value,\ndefined as false, 0, a nil pointer, a nil interface value, and any empty array, slice, map, or string.\n(from https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Marshal)\n\nHint: a workaround for this is to use the extension x-nullable:true on properties.\nOriginally from issue #959. (more discussion on edge cases there).\nRelated: go-openapi/validate#19.\nString parameter in body and query\nUse-case: I want to create an operation with string parameter in body, but go-swagger fails while generating.\nWhen I change body to query, it works. How can I send my parameter in body with type string?\nThis works (param in query):\npost:\n  description: post func\n  operationId: postfunc\n  parameters:\n    - name: myparam\n      in: query\n      type: string\n\nBut this fails (param in body):\npost:\n  description: post func\n  operationId: postfunc\n  parameters:\n    - name: myparam\n      in: body\n      type: string\n\nAnswer: add the schema definition in body. This works:\npost:\n  description: post func\n  operationId: postfunc\n  parameters:\n    - name: myparam\n      in: body\n      required: true\n      schema:\n        type: string\n\nHint: more generally, you might want to check the validity of your spec re the OpenAPI 2.0 schema before trying generation, using the swagger validate {spec} command.\nOriginally from issue #990.\nRequest response can have different objects returned based on query parameters\nUse-Case: I have a POST request that returns different object models based on the query parameters.\nIs there any way to add multiple responses under the swagger route annotation?\nLike:\nResponses:\n  200: response1\n  200: response2\n  ... etc\n\nAlso is it possible to have different models for the request?\nAnswer: No, as this is not supported in Openapi 2.0 specification\nThat being said, if you specify a wrapper class or base class, you can return multiple responses.\nFor example (in pseudo-swagger):\nResponseWrapper:\n  type: object\n  properties:\n    response1:\n      $ref: '#/definitions/response1'\n    response2:\n      $ref: '#/definitions/response2'\n\nor perhaps more elegantly:\nBaseObject:\n  type: object\n  properties:\n    id:\n      type: string\n      format: uuid\n\nResponse1:\n  allOf:\n    - $ref: '#/definitions/BaseObject'\n    - type: object\n      properties:\n        extendedAttributeForResponse1\n\nResponse2:\n  allOf:\n    - $ref: '#/definitions/BaseObject'\n    - type: object\n       properties:\n         extendedAttribForResponse2\n\nAllegedly, with OpenAPI 3.0 you'll be able to use the anyOf: operator, with the different response types.\nRegarding parameters, you may also achieve this by putting in the path the query parameters that dictate the model.\npaths:\n  \"/something?objectType=thisThing\":\n      get:\n...\n  \"/something?objectType=otherThing\":\n      get:\n...\n\nOriginally from issue #932.\nHow to validate dates and times?\nJSON schema and Swagger (aka OpenAPI 2.0) define ISO-8601 dates as a known format (e.g. date-time, or yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z).\nThis format definition is used by go-swagger validators.\nYou just have to define the format as in:\n{\n  \"description\": \"The date and time that the device was registered.\",\n  \"type\":\"string\",\n  \"format\": \"date-time\"\n}\n\nThe go-openapi/strfmt package supports many additional string formats for validation.\nCheck out for more in this repo. The full API\nis documented here.\nRegarding dates, this package extends validation to RFC3339 full-date format (e.g. \"2006-01-02\").\nOriginally from issue #643.\nAccessing the Default return value\nUse-Case: I was wondering how I would get the default response from the client?\nNote: see also Access HTTP status code from client#597.\nI have a spec like this:\n/deploys/{deploy_id}:\n  get:\n    operationId: getDeploy\n    parameters:\n      - name: deploy_id\n        type: string\n        in: path\n        required: true\n    responses:\n      '200':\n        description: OK\n        schema:\n          $ref: \"#/definitions/deploy\"\n      default:\n        description: error\n        schema:\n          $ref: \"#/definitions/error\"\n\nThis spec generates two models: GetDeployOK and GetDeployDefault.

It is a pure 'read' requirement, so no need for parameter validation by the API, just the ability to gain an XML\nor JSON form of the data structure by a client.\nOur organization decided to keep the API and subsystem layers separate, and to perform deep copies between them.\nThe runtime performance costs are acceptable to us, and worth it to keep API-layer dependencies out of our core library.\nIf someone can think of a better solution we would love to know!\nIf we define a data model in the swagger specification, we end up having to do a\ndeep copy of that data structure from subsystem to API if we want to avoid type injection.\n\nHow do you use the swagger spec to define a raw JSON or XML transfer, defined by the subsystem's types?\nHint: you may use the x-go-type model annotation that allows you to use pre-existing types as models, you annotate your spec like this:\nhttps://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/blob/master/fixtures/codegen/existing-model.yml#L99-103\nOriginally from issue #948.\nExtra sections in POST body\nUse-case: additional properties in object\nIf I have a swagger spec that expects\n{\"foo\": 123}\nand provide\n{\"foo\": 123, \"blah\": 345}\nit happily goes on about this way.\nTwo questions:\n\ncan I make it complain if extra stuff is included\ncan I access these extra sections within the go code/handler?\n\nAnswer: use additionalProperties: false or additionalProperties: true in your definition.\nwhen it's set to true you'll have a map[string]interface{} added.\nOriginally from issue #1337.\nHow to support generate type int?\nUse-case: generating int types\n\nI need to use swagger to generate my modes in go code.\nBut I find I can hardly generate type int, always int64.\nSince I need to keep back compatibility for my project, I can hardly change the type.\nSo in this case, does go-swagger meet this requirement?\n\nAnswer:  int is not a good option to support when it comes to contracts.\n\nConsider the following: you have an arm32 client on which int is int32, however your server is amd64.\nAt this stage it's perfectly valid for the server to return int32 max value + 1, this will cause the client to overflow.\nSo while go allows int as type I think for API contracts int is too ambiguous as definition leading to subtle but hard to debug failures.\nSimilarly other languages may choose to default to int32 type instead of int64 type regardless of platform.\n\nOriginally from issue #1205.\nGenerate all models necessary for specified operation\nUse-case: I'm specifying specific operations and I'd like to restrict the models to those needed for those operations. Is there a way to do that?\nAnswer: when using the generate server command, a repeatable --operation=xxx is available to restrict the scope of operations.\n\nNOTE: this option is not available for generate model.\n\nOriginally from issue #1427.\nGenerated code changes the order of properties in struct\nUse-case: the generated struct has attributes ordered differently than the original specification\nExample:\nProduct:\n    type: \"object\"\n    properties:\n      product_id:\n        type: \"string\"\n      name:\n        type: \"string\"\n\nGenerated by \"swagger generate server\":\ntype Product struct {\n    Name string `json:\"name,omitempty\"`\n    ProductID string `json:\"product_id,omitempty\"`\n}\n\nI want product_id be the first property of Product struct.\nIs there any way to keep the order of properties?\nAnswer: try x-order: n extension\nOriginally from issue #1759.\nFail to use swagger generate model -name\nUse-case: I met a problem when I tried to rename the filename of the auto-generated model.\nExample:\n\nswagger generate model -m ./models/vo  --name Person\nunknown models: Person\nswagger generate model -m ./models/vo  -name Person\nunknown models: ame\nswagger generate model -m ./models/vo  -name= Person\nunknown models: ame=\n\n{\n  \"swagger\": \"2.0\",\n   \"info\": {\n        \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n        \"title\": \"Simple API\",\n        \"description\": \"A simple API to learn how to write OpenAPI Specification\"\n    },\n   \"schemes\": [\n        \"http\"\n    ],\n  \"paths\": {\n      \"/persons\":{\n          \"get\":{\n              \"summary\":\"获取一些目标person\",\n              \"description\": \"Returns a list containing all persons.\",\n              \"responses\": {\n                    \"200\": {\n                        \"description\": \"A list of Person\",\n                        \"schema\": {\n                            \"type\": \"array\",\n                            \"items\": {\n                                \"properties\": {\n                                    \"firstName\": {\n                                        \"type\": \"string\"\n                                    },\n                                    \"lastName\": {\n                                        \"type\": \"string\"\n                                    },\n                                    \"username\": {\n                                        \"type\": \"string\"\n                                    }\n                                }\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n          }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nAnswer: you need to make it available with that name in the definitions section then it will know\nOriginally from issue #1517.\n\nBack to all contributions\n"},"faq/faq_server.html":{"url":"faq/faq_server.html","title":"Server generation & customization","keywords":"","body":"\nServer generation and customization\nWhat are the dependencies required by the generated server?\nThe code generation process ends with a message indicating package dependencies for your generated code.\nBasically, here are the required packages:\n\ngithub.com/go-openapi/errors\ngithub.com/go-openapi/loads\ngithub.com/go-openapi/runtime\ngithub.com/go-openapi/spec\ngithub.com/go-openapi/strfmt\ngithub.com/go-openapi/swag\ngithub.com/go-openapi/validate\n\nAnd depending on your generation options, a command line flags handling package:\n\ngithub.com/jessevdk/go-flags, or\ngithub.com/spf13/pflag\nflag\n\nThis dependency used to be necessary up to release 0.14:\n\ngithub.com/tylerb/graceful\n\nThese packages may of course be vendored with your own source.\nOriginally from issue #1085.\nHow to add custom flags?\ngo-swagger ships with an option to select a flag management package: swagger generate server --flag-strategy=[go-flags|pflag|flag]\nYou may of course customize your server to accept arbitrary flags the way you prefer.\nThis should be normally done with the generated main.go. For customization, you may either skip the generation of the main package (--skip-main)\nand provide your own, or customize template generation to generate a custom main.\nHere's an example: kv store example\nOriginally from issue #1036.\nHow do you integrate the flag sets of go-swagger and other packages, in particular, glog?\nUse-case: logger\n\nI am trying to integrate a package into a go-swagger generated API that is using the github.com/golang/glog logger.\nWhen I initialize the glog logger it appears to shield the flags defined in the go-swagger runtime.\n\nAnswer: the generated API has a Logger property that is a function with signature: func(string, ...interface{})\nYou can configure it with any logger that exposes the signature.\neg.: https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/blob/master/examples/authentication/restapi/configure_auth_sample.go#L33\nUse-case: logger flags\n\nStill having a problem with how and where to initialize glog so that both sets of flags are honored:\nthe runtime flags, such as --tls-certificate and the glog flags like -log_dir and -stderrthreshold.\nIf I initialize glog in the config_xxx.go I don't get the go-swagger runtime flags, and if I initialize glog in the engine, I get the error: logging before flag.Parse.\nI realize that this question is not so much about logging per se, but more about how to merge the flag sets defined by different packages.\n\nAnswer: you can generate a server with --flag-strategy pflag\nAfter that you can use its integration to add goflags. You would do this in the main file.\nSubsequently it's probably a good idea to generate code with --exclude-main so the update is preserved.\nSee also: https://github.com/spf13/pflag#supporting-go-flags-when-using-pflag\nExample:\nimport (\n    goflag \"flag\"\n    flag \"github.com/spf13/pflag\"\n)\n\nvar ip *int = flag.Int(\"flagname\", 1234, \"help message for flagname\")\n\nfunc main() {\n    flag.CommandLine.AddGoFlagSet(goflag.CommandLine)\n    flag.Parse()\n}\n\nOriginally from issue #762.\nHow to serve two or more swagger specs from one server?\nUse-case: I want a go-swagger generated server to serve 2 swagger specs that have no overlap on paths.\nOne is a generic metadata api that is implemented by many services and the other is a\nservice-specific api. The built-in server.go template Server struct, by having exactly\none API & handler, appears to prevent this.\nSuggestions:\n\nUse go-swagger mixin command to merge specs into a single one\nCreate yourself a top-level swagger file that just includes the two lower-level ones (using $ref).\nYou may use go-swagger flatten to flatten the resulting spec\nYou can also make your own main function and use the code from the generation\nof both spec (with --skip-main).\nThis allows for customization like using a different middleware stack, which in turn gives you\nthe ability to serve 2 swagger specs at different paths.\n\nOriginally from issue #1005. (comes with a sample main.go for spec composition).\nHow to access access API struct inside operator handler?\nUse-Case:\nmy question is how can I access the generated API interface from within an operation handler function ?\nCan i pass it somehow via context or any other way to do that?\nAnswer: No. It's not reachable from within the handler anywhere.\n\nI created a module like apache access module ACL based on IP address for different URLs.\nInstead of URL for lookup key I decided to use Operation.ID.\nLookup would be faster in that way because each operation has a unique id according to swagger specification.\nThe problem comes when I want to check against that ACL of mine...\n\nSuggestions:\nThis is possible in 2 ways.\n\nfirst way is by using an authenticator,\nthe second way is making a middleware (not global)\n\nExample with Authenticator:\n// Authenticator represents an authentication strategy\n// implementations of Authenticator know how to authenticate the\n// request data and translate that into a valid principal object or an error\ntype Authenticator interface {\n    Authenticate(interface{}) (bool, interface{}, error)\n}\n\nYou may see the schemes currently supported here: https://github.com/go-openapi/runtime/tree/master/security\nExample with Middleware:\n// The middleware configuration is for the handler executors. These do not apply to the swagger.json document.\n// The middleware executes after routing but before authentication, binding and validation.\nfunc setupMiddlewares(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {\n    return handler\n}\n\nto get to the matched route in one of those you can:\nimport \"github.com/gorilla/context\"\ncontext.Get(3, request)\n\nThat gets you a matched route.\n\nNote: it might be worth it to expose Context as an exported method on the API builder.\nThat would be a simple PR to add the following code in go-swagger\nfunc (o *LifecycleManagerAPI) Context() *middleware.Context {\n    if o.context == nil {\n        o.context = middleware.NewRoutableContext(o.spec, o, nil)\n    }\n    return o.context\n}\n\nthen your middleware could take a context in and use RouteInfo(request) like this one: https://github.com/go-openapi/runtime/blob/master/middleware/security.go.\n\nSimilar use-case:\nI have some domain objects I need access to in the handlers (db connection, telemetry client, etc).\nWhat is the recommended way/place to define these and access them in the handlers?\n\nWould I define them in configure_xxx() and make wrapper functions for the handlers to make them accessible?\nOr is there a nice way to add them to the context?\nI was looking for some examples of this but couldn't find anything.\n\nHint: look at this one: https://github.com/go-openapi/kvstore\nThe important takeaway is that main and the handlers have to be pulled outside of the generated code since only configure_xxx() is protected.\nAnd main() doesn't call configureAPI() ...\nthat was a little confusing looking through the other examples and not seeing any changes to the vanilla config code.\nSimilar use-case: dependency injection\nWouldn't it be better to have all the handlers automatically be part of a default struct that simply has a Context member variable or empty interface?\n\nThat would save everyone a lot of copy/paste when we need to inject some info.\nI mean, a different context than the one available on params.HTTPRequest.Context(),\nmore like an application level context, e.g. something I can stuff a database reference or other business state into.\n\nHint: remember that the generated packages are made of a series of files that you can extend and tailor to your own needs by adding more files.\nFor instance, a new (non generated) file in the operations package could bring to life the applicative context/dependencies injection and be called from the configure_xxx.\nYou may alternatively modify the generation by providing your own templates, and possibly extend the interface of the Server struct.\nOriginally from issue #661.\nUse go-swagger to generate different client or servers\nUse-Case:\nI am using go-swagger to generate some part of a server application automatically\nand I would love to reuse our code by transforming the code in go templates.\n\nIt would be  enough to export the appGenerator type and have a function that returns it (maybe generator.GenerateServer itself?).\nI would then use appGenerator to execute the templates.\nHow could I realize this? Is it possible with go-swagger?\n\nAnswer: you can provide your own templates for go-swagger.\nThe client and server generators allow you to specify a directory on disk to add custom templates.\nHere are some docs: http://goswagger.io/generate/templates/\n\nIn VIC they do this: https://github.com/vmware/vic/tree/master/lib/apiservers/templates\nhttps://github.com/vmware/vic/blob/master/Makefile#L274-L281\n\nHint: you can also override templates by using the same names:\nhttps://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/blob/master/generator/templates.go#L61-L73\nWouldn't this generate roughly the same structure of the server?\n\nI don't want to change minor details, I want to have code that looks totally different\n(but only for the server part, models and clients are more than okay) while using code the parsing and validation from go-swagger.\nThis means different number of files and different functionalities.\n\nAnswer: yes, it would generate a similar structure.\nNote: customizing templates already brings many options to the table, including generating artifacts in other languages than go.\nThere is some documentation on the config file format here: https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/blob/gen-layout-configfile/docs/use/template_layout.md\nAlso keep in mind that go-openapi and go-swagger constitute a toolkit\nand provide you the tools to adapt to your own use case.\nThe swagger command line and standard templates only covers general purpose use-cases.\nIf you think your use-case would benefit to many people, feel free to make the necessary changes for your case to work and submitting a PR.\nExample config file for generation:\nlayout:\n  application:\n    - name: configure\n      source: asset:serverConfigureapi\n      target: \"{{ joinFilePath .Target .ServerPackage }}\"\n      file_name: \"{{ .Name }}_client.go\"\n      skip_exists: true\n    - name: main\n      source: asset:serverMain\n      target: \"{{ joinFilePath .Target \\\"cmd\\\" (dasherize (pascalize .Name)) }}-server\"\n      file_name: \"main.go\"\n    - name: embedded_spec\n      source: asset:swaggerJsonEmbed\n      target: \"{{ joinFilePath .Target .ServerPackage }}\"\n      file_name: \"embedded_spec.go\"\n    - name: server\n      source: asset:serverServer\n      target: \"{{ joinFilePath .Target .ServerPackage }}\"\n      file_name: \"server.go\"\n    - name: builder\n      source: asset:serverBuilder\n      target: \"{{ joinFilePath .Target .ServerPackage .Package }}\"\n      file_name: \"{{ snakize (pascalize .Name) }}_api.go\"\n    - name: doc\n      source: asset:serverDoc\n      target: \"{{ joinFilePath .Target .ServerPackage }}\"\n      file_name: \"doc.go\"\n  models:\n   - name: definition\n     source: asset:model\n     target: \"{{ joinFilePath .Target .ModelPackage }}\"\n     file_name: \"{{ (snakize (pascalize .Name)) }}.go\"\n  operations:\n   - name: parameters\n     source: asset:serverParameter\n     target: \"{{ joinFilePath .Target .ServerPackage .APIPackage .Package }}\"\n     file_name: \"{{ (snakize (pascalize .Name)) }}_parameters.go\"\n   - name: responses\n     source: asset:serverResponses\n     target: \"{{ joinFilePath .Target .ServerPackage .APIPackage .Package }}\"\n     file_name: \"{{ (snakize (pascalize .Name)) }}_responses.go\"\n   - name: handler\n     source: asset:serverOperation\n     target: \"{{ joinFilePath .Target .ServerPackage .APIPackage .Package }}\"\n     file_name: \"{{ (snakize (pascalize .Name)) }}.go\"\n\nSupport streaming responses\nUse-Case: Docker client expects a stream of JSON structs from daemon to show a progress bar, as in:\ncurl -i -X POST http://IP:PORT/images/create?fromImage=alpine&tag=latest\n\nHow could I write a server providing a streaming response?\nAnswer: Operations in the generated server are expected to return a responder.\nThis interface is defined as:\n// Responder is an interface for types to implement\n// when they want to be considered for writing HTTP responses\ntype Responder interface {\n    WriteResponse(http.ResponseWriter, httpkit.Producer)\n}\n\nWith the middleware.ResponderFunc helper construct, you can just write a func(http.ResponseWriter, httpkit.Producer)\nwhere you want a streaming response.\nThis should be sufficient. However:\n\nI've toyed with a channel based stream where you send struct objects to a channel, which then gets streamed to the browser.\nI decided against this because it seemed to just add complexity for little benefit.\nI can be persuaded to implement such a responder though, and should somebody send a PR like that I would not say no to it.\n\nOriginally from issue #305.\nOAuth authentication does not redirect to the authorization server\nUse-Case: oauth2 accessCode flow does not redirect to the authorization server\n\nIn my understanding, if the accessCode flow is used for oauth2 securitydefinition, the generated server could redirect the authentication to the oauth2 server, e.g., https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth. However, my generated code does not perform the redirection. Could anyone help on this? Thanks.\n\nLike in:\n---\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  title: oauth2 debug\n  version: 0.3.0\nproduces:\n- application/json\nschemes:\n  - http\nbasePath: /api\nsecurityDefinitions:\n  OauthSecurity:\n    type: oauth2\n    flow: accessCode\n    authorizationUrl: 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth'\n    tokenUrl: 'hhttps://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token'\n    scopes:\n      admin: Admin scope\n      user: User scope\nsecurity:\n  - OauthSecurity:\n    - user\npaths:\n  /customers:\n  ....\n\n\nThe generated server does not redirect the browser to the google login page.\n\nAnswer: Redirection flow is for UI. The spec has them so your UI can do the redirection.\nSwagger 2.0 only defines those properties as hints for a UI to work,\nthis doesn't have to be server side. At the same time the redirection flow is not supported in an API\nbut you can use an OAuth 2.0 middleware from any library to get you that functionality\nOriginally from issue #1217.\nHTTPS TLS Cipher Suites not supported by AWS Elastic LoadBalancer\nUse-case: AWS Elastic LoadBalancer forwards https requests to instances, and their security policy is 'ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08'.\nHowever, while running the server on https, the server keeps on logging\nhttp: TLS handshake error from 192.168.X.X:XXXXX: tls: no cipher suite supported by both client and server.\nIf we remove the cipher suites on the generated code, it resolves the issue -\nCipherSuites: []uint16{\n  tls.TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,\n  tls.TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,\n  tls.TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,\n  tls.TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,\n},\n\nThe ELB security policy 'ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08' does include these cipher suites, however all requests sent by the ELB are rejected by the server.\nAnswer: you can generate the server with a different compatibility mode for the older generation of ciphers\nswagger generate server --compatibility-mode=intermediate\nOriginally from issue #1383.\nWhich mime types are supported?\nUse-Case: I seem to be unable to find supported mime-types that the API's can consume and produce.

I see mixed examples about this.\n\n\nAnswers:\n\nQ1: nope. It needs to be declared in the same app and it needs to be imported so that goswagger can find it by following imports starting at the main package.\nQ2: you would add all of them in the parameter struct at this moment, in the case of parameters you would add a doc comment: // in: path. Take a look at some of the generated code examples because they contain all the known annotations as well.\nQ3: not case sensitive, didn't want to have debates over casing. Whatever looks good to you in docs is what you can use.\n\nOne more question: Can methods in an interface be annotated?\nAnswer: only when it's used in a discriminator IIRC. There is code in the scan package that treats nullary methods as properties if certain conditions are met.\n\nMy generated spec is now working but seems to be missing a parameter \"description\" to indicate to end user of the API URL endpoint of what's its doing.

params?\nUse-Case: I defined a route with!\n// swagger:route GET /services/{serviceName}/version/{version} pets listOneService\n\nHow to comment the two params('serviceName' and 'version')?\nAnswer: swagger:params is used to indicate which operations the properties of the operation are included in the struct.\nSo you'd use something like these:\nhttps://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/blob/master/fixtures/goparsing/petstore/rest/handlers/orders.go#L24-L46\nor:\n// swagger:params listOneService\ntype ListOneParams struct {\n    //

from source, I get empty definitions.\nAnswer: models are discovered through usage in parameter and/or response objects.\nIf the model isn't used through a parameter or response object it's not part of the API because there is no way that it goes in or out through the API.\nExample:\ndoc.go\n// Schemes: http, https\n// Host: localhost\n// BasePath: /v1\n// Version: 0.0.1\n// License: MIT

expected working behavior, but\nI don't want to add additional level of structs just to support pretty output.\nAnswer: you can rename the model in the json with the swagger:model doc tag on the response\ndata struct, that would get you the expected output.\n// swagger:response SuccessResponse\ntype SuccessResponse struct {\n    // In: body\n    Data ResponseData `json:\"data\"`\n}\n\n//

This allows us to discover your application and which files to scan for the doc comments.\n\nThis application needs to read composed structs and so on, and it's a lot easier to interrogate the application if you know where all the files are and not just the ones you created in this particular folder.\nUnfortunately it does require to be able to read\n\nHow about a main class that doesn't require appengine imports?\nI've personally never used appening so I don't really know what is involved.\n\nFor an app engine app, typically the main.go doesn't require any of the special appengine imports... however it uses an init() function instead of a main() function, and in there is where you instantiate the router and bind all the routes to handlers. It is the handlers (usually in their own separate files) which need the appengine imports.\n\nI don't know if that's what you are asking about, but I know app engine fairly well so I can answer more questions if you have any.\n\nI guess what I mean is if your code doesn't compile, how are you running it?\nAnd what I also meant is; if this is important to you, you could look at forking and submitting a pull request.\nI, personally, still have a bunch of other things that need fixing in here before I want to look at a niche like appengine.\n\nFair enough, if you're not interested in supporting app engine that's fine. I did try forking to fix that other bug that I filed, but the code was a bit over my head so I wasn't able to fix it.\n\nTo answer your question, app engine apps don't get compiled with \"go build\", instead they are run on a dev server provided by the app engine SDK, and then they are deployed to app engine and run on the Google Cloud Platform infrastructure. The only reason they don't compile is because some of the packages (\"appengine\", \"appengine/datastore\", etc.) are only available in this SDK environment, they are not found in $GOPATH.\n\nMaybe app engine could improve this situation in the future, and then go-swagger wouldn't have to change to support it, but as it stands now this will not work with any app engine apps that use any of the appengine-specific imports.\n\nI will go back to using github.com/yvasiyarov/swagger for now, which doesn't require the app to build to generate the spec, but it is also not generating swagger 2.0, so I hope I can use your package sometime in the future.\n\nbut the custom sdk they use also includes a custom go command doesn't it?\nI think the problem you're having is related to your GOPATH content and can be fixed there.\n\nafaik go always needs to compile your stuff, whether that's in the SDK env or not, have you tried installing go-swagger in the SDK provided GOPATH?\n\nI'll leave this open so i can track this\nHmm that is an interesting thought. I will experiment more on this today.\nThe app engine SDK definitely uses the regular system GOPATH to resolve most of the includes, but it maybe has another internal GOPATH also,\nI'm not sure. Will post my findings a bit later.\n\nWow! You're right man! All that was needed to make generate spec work, was to add this to GOPATH:\n[go_appengine_sdk_location]/goroot\n\nThe appengine includes are in there. It's working now, thanks for the insight!\n\nOriginally from issue [#47](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/47).\n-->\n\n\nBack to all contributions\n"},"faq/faq_testing.html":{"url":"faq/faq_testing.html","title":"API testing","keywords":"","body":"\nAPI testing\nAny suggestions how to leverage the generated client for benchmarking the API?\nUse-Case: I want to benchmark the throughput and latency of different API calls.\n\nI can think of using the go testing/benchmarking framework and hand role the API calls, or I can leverage the generated client and augment it with a benchmarking framework.\n\nWhat have others done?\nAt the moment, the toolkit does not generate testing tools.

Pull requests to move on forward in that direction are welcome.\nOriginally from issue #787.\nUsing httptest\nUse-Case: I would like to use httptest for testing my handlers.\nGo-swagger provides a Server, but not a configured handler. \nHint: I use this hack : in a file test.go in the restapi folder, I steal the private configureAPI function. It works.\npackage restapi\n\nimport (\n    loads \"github.com/go-openapi/loads\"\n    \"github.com/pim/pam/poum/restapi/operations\"\n    \"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc getAPI() (*operations.ThefactoryAPI, error) {\n    swaggerSpec, err := loads.Analyzed(SwaggerJSON, \"\")\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    api := operations.NewThefactoryAPI(swaggerSpec)\n    return api, nil\n}\n\nfunc GetAPIHandler() (http.Handler, error) {\n    api, err := getAPI()\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    h := configureAPI(api)\n    err = api.Validate()\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    return h, nil\n}\n\nAnd I can use this in tests like this:\nhandler, err := restapi.GetAPIHandler()\nif err != nil {\n    t.Fatal(\"get api handler\", err)\n}\nts := httptest.NewServer(handler)\ndefer ts.Close()\nres, err := http.Get(ts.URL + \"/api/v1/boxes\")\n\nBut, hacking restapi, which use my handlers is cyclic, I can't drop my test near my handlers, and this is still a hack.\nWhat is the official way to manage handler testing?\nHint: you don't actually need httptest to test the handlers.\nA handler is essentially a function of parameters to result.\nThe result knows how to write itself to a http.ResponseWriter, and you already know that that part works.\nSo to test a handler what you require is to test just your code.\nSo to test the AddOne operation from the todo list this, there are 2 functions involved in the implementation.\nThe first function uses the data from the request to actually write the todo item to a store, this can be tested separately.\nfunc addItem(item *models.Item) error {\n    if item == nil {\n        return errors.New(500, \"item must be present\")\n    }\n\n    itemsLock.Lock()\n    defer itemsLock.Unlock()\n\n    newID := newItemID()\n    item.ID = newID\n    items[newID] = item\n\n    return nil\n}\n\nThen there is the actual handler:\ntodos.AddOneHandlerFunc(func(params todos.AddOneParams) middleware.Responder {\n    if err := addItem(params.Body); err != nil {\n        return todos.NewAddOneDefault(500).WithPayload(&models.Error{Code: 500, Message: swag.String(err.Error())})\n    }\n    return todos.NewAddOneCreated().WithPayload(params.Body)\n})\n\nTo test this second function we don't need to use the httptest package, you can assume that that part of the code works.

This differs from json-Schema spec.\n\nOriginally from issue #1552.\nUse-Case: go-swagger rejects default object that misses required properties.\n\nMy understanding is that properties in default and those listed as required are mutually exclusive, because one is supposed\nto explicitly provide required properties, while properties in default can be filled in.\nSee https://swagger.io/blog/unlocking-the-spec-the-default-keyword\n\nExample:\npaths:\n  /person/{id}:\n    put:\n      summary: Put a person\n      description: Put a person.\n      consumes:\n        - application/json\n      parameters:\n        - name: id\n          in: path\n          description: ID of person\n          required: true\n          type: integer\n        - in: body\n          name: body\n          description: Person\n          schema:\n            type: object\n            required:\n              - username\n            default:\n              firstName: John\n              lastName: Smith\n            properties:\n              firstName:\n                type: string\n              lastName:\n                type: string\n              username:\n                type: string\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: successful\n\nAnswer: the spec validation warns you about mixing up default with required.\n\nIf you override this validation (with swagger generate model --skip-validation), the model generator would override the\nrequired clause, and use the default.\n\nWould --skip-validation skip any other validations?\nAnswer: Yes. --skip-validation skips the call to swagger validate {spec}, which is normally carried on before generation.\nFor some use cases, we have to, since go-swagger supports constructs that are not stricly swagger-compliant.\nThis one is an example: some override silently take place here at generation time.\nOriginally from issue #1501.\ntype string, format int64 not respected in generator\nUse-Case:  when generating parameters or models from a swagger file with a definition that specifies type: string and format: int64,\n the generation fails.\nExample:\n{\n    \"consumes\": [\n        \"application/json\"\n    ],\n    \"definitions\": {\n        \"Test\": {\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"id\": {\n                    \"format\": \"int64\",\n                    \"type\": \"string\"\n                }\n            },\n            \"type\": \"object\"\n        }\n    },\n...\n\nAnswer: that's an invalid type. The openapi 2.0 spec says the type should be\ntype: integer\nformat: int64\nOriginally from issue #1381.\nDuplicate operationId error\nUse-Case:  my spec indicates duplicate operationIds but for separate endpoints.\nWhen generating a server and there are multiple endpoints, the operations directory in restapi\ncontains subdirectories for each of those endpoints.\nExample:\npaths:\n  '/users/{id}':\n    parameters:\n      - name: id\n        in: path\n        required: true\n        type: string\n    get:\n      operationId: getById\n      summary: Get User By ID\n      tags:\n        - Users\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: ''\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/definitions/user-output'\n  '/pets/{id}':\n    parameters:\n      - name: id\n        in: path\n        required: true\n        type: string\n    get:\n      operationId: getById\n      summary: Get Pet By ID\n      tags:\n        - Pets\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: ''\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/definitions/pet-output'\n\nI am expecting a generated structure like so:\n└── restapi\n    ...\n    ├── operations\n    │   ├── pets\n    │   │   ├── ...\n    │   ├── users\n    │   │   ├── ...\n    │   └── ...\nHowever, instead of generating the server I get this error: \"getById\" is defined 2 times\nIs it possible to bypass this validation error IF the operation ids will go into separate directories?\nAnswer: operationId is always globally unique per swagger 2.0 specification. The id MUST be unique among all operations described in the API.\nhttps://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#operationObject\n\nUnique string used to identify the operation. The id MUST be unique among all operations described in the API.\nTools and libraries MAY use the operationId to uniquely identify an operation,\ntherefore, it is recommended to follow common programming naming conventions.\n\nOriginally from issue #1143.\n\nBack to all contributions\n"}}}
